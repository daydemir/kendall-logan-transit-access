# Short-Term Solutions: Kendall-Logan Shuttle Options (0-5 Years)

**Timeline**: 0-2 years for pilot, 2-5 years for full service
**Philosophy**: Maximum benefit with minimal infrastructure investment

---

## Executive Summary

A **direct Kendall-Logan shuttle** is the highest-impact short-term solution:
- **Travel time**: 12-15 min (vs 40+ min current transit)
- **Proven model**: Back Bay Logan Express doubled ridership after 2019 improvements
- **Launch timeline**: 3-6 months (corporate pilot) or 12-18 months (Logan Express)
- **Cost**: $300-400K pilot, $1.5-2M/year full service

---

## Option 1: Kendall Logan Express (RECOMMENDED)

### The Model: Back Bay Logan Express
| Metric | Back Bay | Proposed Kendall |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| Fare | $3 to Logan, FREE return | Same |
| Frequency | Every 30 min | Every 30 min |
| Travel time | ~15-20 min | 12-15 min |
| Ridership | Doubled after 2019 improvements | Higher density expected |
| Funding | Massport subsidized | Same |

### Route
**Kendall → Broadway → Main St → Route 1A → Sumner Tunnel → Logan**
- Distance: 3-4 miles
- Off-peak: 12-15 minutes
- Peak hours: 20-25 minutes

### Key Features (Back Bay Model)
- TSA PreCheck "Ticket to Skip" for passengers
- FREE return from Logan
- Real-time tracking
- Luggage-friendly vehicles

### Implementation
| Phase | Timeline | Cost |
|-------|----------|------|
| Advocacy/planning | 0-6 months | $0 |
| Massport approval | 6-12 months | $0 |
| 2-year pilot | 12-36 months | $1.5-2M/year |
| Permanent service | Year 3+ | $1.5-2M/year |

## Option 2: Corporate/KSA Pilot (Fastest Launch)

### Concept
Employer consortium funds initial pilot to prove demand before Massport investment.

### Structure
- **Operators**: Lease 2 Ford Transit vans (15-passenger, no CDL required)
- **Schedule**: AM peak (6-9am) + PM peak (4-7pm), every 30 min
- **Funding**: 10 KSA member companies × $30-40K = $300-400K/year

### Costs
| Item | Year 1 Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Vehicle lease (2 vans) | $40-60K |
| Insurance | $15-25K |
| Fuel/maintenance | $30-40K |
| Driver labor | $120-150K |
| Marketing/tech | $10-20K |
| **Total** | **$215-295K** |

### Timeline: 3-6 Months
1. KSA convenes employer interest (Month 1)
2. Contract with operator (Month 2)
3. Secure permits (Months 2-4)
4. Launch pilot (Month 5-6)

### Transition Path
- 6-month pilot proves demand
- Use ridership data to pitch Massport
- Transition to Logan Express model

## Option 3: Kendall-Bowdoin Shuttle (FREE, Minimal Investment)

### The Concept
A **free micro-shuttle** connecting Kendall to Bowdoin station, closing the Red-Blue gap cheaply until the real connector is built (2031).

### Comparison: Kendall-Bowdoin vs Kendall-Logan

| Factor | Kendall → Bowdoin | Kendall → Logan |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Distance** | ~1.3 miles | ~3.5 miles |
| **Shuttle time** | 5-8 min | 15-25 min |
| **Total to terminal** | 20-25 min (+ Blue Line) | 15-25 min |
| **Transfers** | 1 (to Blue Line) | 0 |
| **Operating cost** | ~$80-120K/year | ~$1.5-2M/year |
| **Vehicle needs** | 1-2 small EVs | 2-3 buses |
| **Traffic exposure** | Minimal (short route) | High (tunnel congestion) |
| **Fare** | FREE (employer subsidized) | $3-7 |

### Why This Is Clever

1. **Closes the Red-Blue gap cheaply** - Micro Red-Blue Connector until 2031
2. **Could be FREE** - At ~$100K/year, KSA members could easily subsidize ($1K/company × 100 companies)
3. **Leverages Blue Line** - Blue Line runs every 4-5 min to Airport (8-10 min ride)
4. **Avoids tunnel traffic** - Shuttle stays in Cambridge/Boston entirely
5. **Resilient** - If shuttle delayed, walk from Charles/MGH (15 min) as backup
6. **Doesn't clog Kendall-Logan route** - Complements rather than competes with direct shuttle

### Caveats

| Issue | Mitigation |
|-------|------------|
| Bowdoin accessibility | ADA riders use direct Logan shuttle instead |
| Station future (closes ~2031) | Service transitions to Charles/MGH when Red-Blue opens |
| Transfer penalty | Position as FREE option; premium travelers use Logan shuttle |
| Luggage on Blue Line | Not ideal; heavy luggage users take direct shuttle |

### Implementation

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Vehicle lease (1-2 electric vans) | $20-30K/year |
| Insurance | $10-15K/year |
| Driver labor (part-time) | $40-60K/year |
| Fuel/maintenance | $10-15K/year |
| **Total** | **$80-120K/year** |

### Route
**Kendall T → Third St → Cambridge St → Bowdoin Station**
- Distance: 1.3 miles
- Time: 5-8 minutes
- Frequency: Every 10-15 minutes during peak

**Verdict**: Run BOTH as complementary services - free Bowdoin shuttle for cost-conscious travelers, paid Logan Express for premium/luggage needs.

---

## Option 4: Enhanced Blue Line Connection (Via Red-Blue Connector)

### What It Enables
Once Red-Blue Connector opens (~2031):
- Red Line → Charles/MGH → Blue Line → Airport station
- Total: ~25-30 min (vs 40+ current)

### Why Shuttle Still Matters
- Red-Blue is 5-7 years away
- Still requires Airport shuttle to terminals
- Shuttle is 12-15 min vs 25-30 min

**Verdict**: Shuttle complements Red-Blue Connector, doesn't compete.

## Funding Sources

### Primary: Massport
- Already funds entire Logan Express network
- Back Bay precedent: $1.5-2M/year subsidy
- Motivation: Reduce airport roadway congestion

### Secondary: Corporate/Institutional
| Entity | Potential Contribution |
|--------|------------------------|
| Google Cambridge | $50-100K/year |
| Microsoft NERD | $50-100K/year |
| Biotech (Moderna, Biogen, etc.) | $50-100K each |
| MIT | $50-100K/year |
| KSA pooled fund | $100-200K/year |

### Tertiary: Public Funding
- KSTEP (Kendall Square Transit Enhancement Program) - developer mitigation fees
- City of Cambridge economic development
- Federal CMAQ grants (precedent: Kansas $2M for airport shuttle pilot)

---

## Implementation Checklist

### Permits Required
- [ ] MA DPU passenger carrier license (3-6 months)
- [ ] Cambridge curbside permit (2-4 months)
- [ ] Massport operating agreement ($100 application fee)
- [ ] Vehicle permits per shuttle
- [ ] Insurance certificates

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Bus stop/shelter at Kendall T station
- [ ] Real-time tracking system
- [ ] Ticketing integration (CharlieCard?)
- [ ] TSA partnership for PreCheck benefits

### Vehicles

- No CDL required for <16 passengers
- Electric option: Ford E-Transit ($60-80K)

---

## Demand Analysis

### Kendall Square Profile
- 50,000+ workers
- High business traveler concentration (biotech, tech, pharma)
- MIT (11,000+ students, 13,000+ staff)
- Hotels (Marriott, Hyatt, etc.)

### Comparable: Back Bay
- Lower business traveler density than Kendall
- Yet ridership DOUBLED after 2019 improvements
- **Kendall should perform even better**

### Ridership Projections
| Scenario | Daily Riders | Annual | Revenue (at $3) |
|----------|--------------|--------|-----------------|
| Conservative | 75 | 19,500 | $58,500 |
| Moderate | 150 | 39,000 | $117,000 |
| Optimistic | 250 | 65,000 | $195,000 |

Break-even at ~$1.5M/year subsidy: Need 34 riders/day at $10 fare, or 100 riders/day at $3 fare + subsidy.

## Recommendation: Three-Tier "Barbell" Approach

### Tier 1: FREE Kendall-Bowdoin Shuttle (Immediate, Minimal Cost)
- KSA employer consortium funds ~$100K/year
- Launch in 3-4 months (simplest permits)
- Closes Red-Blue gap until 2031
- Serves cost-conscious travelers, light luggage

### Tier 2: Corporate Logan Pilot (Fast, Premium)
- Same employer consortium, separate service
- Launch in 6 months
- Direct to terminals, $5-7 fare
- Cost: $250-400K/year

### Tier 3: Logan Express Kendall (Sustainable)
- KSA advocates to Massport during pilots
- Use ridership data from Tiers 1 & 2 as justification
- Target: Massport commitment by Month 12
- Full service by Month 24

### Why All Three?
| Tier | Speed | Cost | Who It Serves |
|------|-------|------|---------------|
| Bowdoin shuttle | 3-4 months | $100K/year | Budget travelers, light bags |
| Corporate Logan | 6 months | $300K/year | Premium, heavy luggage |
| Logan Express | 18-24 months | $0 (Massport) | Everyone, permanently |

**The "barbell"**: Minimal investment (Tier 1) + premium service (Tier 2) = maximum coverage while avoiding expensive middle-ground solutions.

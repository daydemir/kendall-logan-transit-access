# Research Summary: Kendall Square to Logan Airport Transit Access

## The Assignment

You're a consultant for the **Kendall Square Association (KSA)** developing a plan to improve transit access between Kendall Square and Logan Airport. Current options are poor (40+ min via Red/Silver or multiple transfers via Blue Line), leading business travelers to use cars/rideshares, causing congestion and emissions in East Boston (an Environmental Justice community).

## Tiered Solutions Analysis

### Tier 1: Short-Term (0-5 years) - HIGHEST PRIORITY

**Kendall-Logan Shuttle** (see `01-short-term-shuttle-options.md`)
- **Recommended**: Direct shuttle modeled on Back Bay Logan Express
- **Travel time**: 12-15 min (vs 40+ current)
- **Cost**: $300-400K pilot, $1.5-2M/year full service
- **Funding**: Massport (already subsidizes Logan Express network)
- **Dual-track approach**: Corporate pilot in 6 months + parallel Massport advocacy

### Tier 2: Medium-Term (5-10 years)

**Red-Blue Connector** (see `02-red-blue-connector.md`)
- **Cost**: $850M | **Timeline**: 2028-2031
- **Honest assessment**: Only ~10-15 min savings for Kendall→Logan
- **Stronger case**: Equity benefit for East Boston/Revere/Chelsea accessing Cambridge jobs
- **Recommendation**: Support it, but don't position as primary airport solution

**Grand Junction Rail** (see `03-grand-junction-rail.md`)
- **Cost**: $378-667M | **Timeline**: Mid-2030s
- **Key finding**: Provides MORE benefit to Kendall at 1/20th the cost of NSRL
- **What it is**: Existing rail corridor through Kendall, direct to North Station
- **Blockage**: Needs West Station (Allston) + electrification
- **University funding opportunity**: Harvard/MIT could contribute $100M each

### Tier 3: Long-Term (15-25+ years)

**NSRL (North-South Rail Link)** (see `05-nsrl-analysis.md`)
- **Cost**: $8-21 billion | **Status**: Not actively pursued
- **Benefits**: Unifies north/south commuter rail, $30B projected benefits
- **For Kendall specifically**: Grand Junction is better investment at 1/20th cost
- **Key message**: Support in principle, but don't wait for it

**South Station-Logan Tunnel** (see `04-south-station-logan-tunnel.md`)
- **Cost**: $8-15 billion | **Timeline**: 2040s if started now
- **Status**: Concept-level proposal by Fred Salvucci (Jan 2024)
- **Realistic scenario**: Would follow NSRL as Phase 2

## The 50-Year Vision

**New Regional Airport** (see `06-new-regional-airport.md`)
- **Core insight**: Logan is in the wrong location - too close to downtown, can't expand, in EJ community
- **Model**: Netherlands Schiphol (serves 17.8M people with one rail-connected airport)
- **Best site**: Fort Devens (40 miles, 4,400 acres state-owned, on Fitchburg Line)
- **Timeline**: 25-35 years with opposition
- **EJ framing**: New airport provides remedy for East Boston's decades of pollution burden

**Airport Growth Projections** (see `07-airport-growth-projections.md`)
- **Critical finding**: Logan hits capacity (~55-60M passengers) by **2032**
- **New airport lead time**: 15-25 years
- **Conclusion**: Massachusetts is ALREADY BEHIND SCHEDULE on planning
- **The math**: Even if planning starts now, 8-18 year gap of severe congestion

## Recommended Framework for Policy Memo

1. **Short-term** (immediate): Kendall-Logan Express shuttle
2. **Medium-term** (2030s): Red-Blue Connector + Grand Junction rail
3. **Long-term** (2040s+): NSRL + new regional airport planning
4. **Equity lens**: Every proposal framed as benefiting East Boston EJ community
5. **Urgency**: Logan capacity crisis coming in 7 years - must act now

## Cost-Benefit Summary

| Solution | Cost | Time Savings | Timeline | Political Viability |
|----------|------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| Kendall-Logan Shuttle | $1.5-2M/year | 25-30 min | 6-18 months | HIGH |

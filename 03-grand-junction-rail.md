# Grand Junction Rail: Direct Commuter Rail to Kendall

**Timeline**: Medium-term (2030s, dependent on West Station)
**Cost**: $378-667 million
**Key Finding**: Provides MORE benefit to Kendall at 1/20th the cost of NSRL

## What Is The Grand Junction?

An **existing rail corridor running directly through Kendall Square**:
- Built: 1847-1856
- Owner: MassDOT (purchased from CSX in 2009 for $100M)
- Current use: Occasional freight, MBTA equipment transfers
- Route: West Station (Allston) → BU Bridge → MIT → Kendall Square → East Cambridge → North Station

**This is the ONLY surface rail connection between Boston's north and south rail networks.**

## October 2024 CRA Feasibility Study

The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority released comprehensive study (funded by Boston Properties as Kendall development mitigation):

### Cost Estimates
| Configuration | Cost |
|---------------|------|
| Track renovation only | $187-282 million |
| With Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) | $331-427 million |
| With Battery-Electric Multiple Units (BEMUs) | $378-667 million |
| Extended route (to Lynn) | $515M-1.25B |

### Service Plan
- Frequency: Every 15-17.5 minutes
- Technology: Electric or battery-electric (NOT diesel - critical for urban context)
- Ridership: 5,800-9,800 daily initially, up to 11,200 by 2040
- Time savings: Up to 40 minutes for North Shore/Worcester commuters to Kendall

### Proposed Stations
1. **West Station** (Allston) - connects to Worcester/Framingham Line
2. **Cambridgeport** - serves residential neighborhood
3. **MIT/Massachusetts Avenue** - serves MIT campus core
4. **Kendall Square** - direct service to biotech/tech hub
5. **East Cambridge** - serves residential area, Lechmere adjacent
6. **North Station** - connects to all northern commuter rail lines

## Why Grand Junction Changes Everything for Kendall

### Current Kendall → Airport Options
```
Kendall → Red Line → Downtown → Transfer → North Station → Commuter Rail → Airport
         (8 min)      (10 min)              (wait 15-45 min)   (varies)
```

### With Grand Junction
```
Kendall → Grand Junction → North Station → Commuter Rail → Airport
         (10-12 min direct)  (wait 5-15 min)  (varies)
```

### Time Savings by Destination
| Airport | Current | With Grand Junction | Savings |
|---------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Beverly Regional | 82-106 min | 63-84 min | ~20 min |
| Devens (Fitchburg Line) | 100-145 min | 90-112 min | 10-35 min |
| Logan (via North Station→Blue) | 39-56 min | Similar | Minimal |

## Grand Junction vs NSRL for Kendall

| Factor | Grand Junction | NSRL |
|--------|----------------|------|
| **Cost** | $378-667 million | $8-21 billion |
| **Direct Kendall service** | YES | NO (still need Red Line transfer) |
| **Timeline** | Mid-2030s (with West Station) | 15-20+ years if ever |
| **Worcester Line access** | YES (via West Station) | NO (Worcester doesn't use NSRL) |
| **Fitchburg/Lowell access** | YES (via North Station) | YES |
| **Political viability** | Moderate | Low |

**Grand Junction provides MORE benefit to Kendall at 1/20th the cost of NSRL.**

## Critical Dependencies

### 1. West Station (I-90 Allston Multimodal Project)
- Status: Part of $1.9B highway/transit project
- Timeline: Construction late 2027, opening mid-2030s
- Funding: Harvard committed $90M, BU committed $10M
- Critical: Grand Junction's western terminus

### 2. North Station Draw One Bridge Replacement
- Status: $472 million federal grant awarded September 2024
- Problem: 100+ year old drawbridge is bottleneck
- Must be replaced before frequent Grand Junction service

### 3. Grade Crossing Upgrades
- Challenge: 6 at-grade crossings through Cambridge
- Current: Only flashing lights; trains slow to 10 mph
- Required: Full gates, signal timing, potential grade separation

---

## Why 2010-2011 Proposal Failed

MassDOT proposed running Worcester Line trains via Grand Junction in 2010-2011. Opposition came from:
- Cambridge residents (noise, vibration, safety)
- Grade crossing impacts
- Diesel locomotive emissions
- MIT campus disruption concerns

**December 2011**: MassDOT announced "not pursuing" and chose South Station expansion instead.

### What's Different Now (2024)
- Electric/battery-electric technology eliminates diesel concerns
- Modern trains are quieter with better acceleration
- Kendall Square development has increased dramatically (more beneficiaries)
- West Station project creates natural western terminus
- Climate pressure for transit alternatives
- Fresh CRA study with updated analysis

---

## University Funding Opportunity

### Precedent: Stanford + Caltrain
Stanford committed $30.3 million for regional transit as part of $4.7B community benefits package.

### Proposed for Grand Junction
| Entity | Contribution | Rationale |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Harvard | $50-100M | Already committed $90M to West Station; Allston landowner |
| MIT | $50-100M | Direct beneficiary; owns key land parcels |
| Boston Properties | $20-50M | Kendall developer; funded CRA study |
| Boston University | $10-20M | Already committed $10M to West Station |
| State/Federal | $200-400M | Remainder |
| **Total** | **$378-667M** | Full project funded |

---

## Recommendation

### Priority Level: HIGH
Grand Junction should be **Tier 2 priority** (after short-term shuttle, alongside Red-Blue Connector).

### Key Message for Stakeholders
> "Grand Junction passenger service would give Kendall Square direct rail access to every commuter rail line in the system - both north and south - for under $700 million. This is 1/20th the cost of NSRL and provides MORE benefit to Kendall specifically."

### For Universities
> "You own the land, you benefit from the access, you have the endowments. A $100M contribution each would unlock $400M in matching funds and transform Kendall's connectivity."

### Environmental Burdens from Logan Airport

**Daily Pollution:**
- 15 tons of harmful pollutants daily from airport operations
- 35,000+ pounds of pollution daily including airport-related traffic
- 810,000 metric tons of greenhouse gases per year (equivalent to 175,000 passenger cars)

**Health Impacts:**
- Children in East Boston are **4x more likely** to exhibit signs of asthma compared to other areas
- East Boston is a "hotspot" for many types of cancer, suggesting environmental causes
- Adults with COPD more likely to have lived in high-exposure areas near Logan
- Ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) linked to asthma, heart problems, cognitive delays
- Airport pollution plumes extend roughly 6 miles, depending on wind direction

**Other Environmental Challenges:**
- Home to most Boston area stored heating oil and jet fuel
- Large piles of road salt storage
- Multiple highways run through neighborhood
- **Lowest tree canopy coverage** in Boston due to airport infrastructure
- Limited recreational space after airport expansion took 70 acres including Wood Island Park (1967)

### 2024 Regulatory Developments
- Massachusetts DEP announced requirement to analyze **cumulative impacts** for air quality permits near EJ populations (first state to do so)
- Secretary Rebecca Tepper directed Massport to:
  - Address health, air quality, and community impacts
  - Create working group with community

## 2. DUKAKIS CENTER & TRANSPORTATION BURDEN RESEARCH

### Key Report: Transportation Burden on Low-Income Latino Communities (2013)

**Study Details:**
- **Commissioned by:** Barr Foundation
- **Conducted by:** Northeastern University Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy & Neighbor to Neighbor
- **Survey period:** October 2012 - January 2013
- **Sample:** 362 mostly low-income Latino residents in East Boston, Lynn, Worcester, and Springfield

### Key Findings for East Boston

**Transit Dependence:**
- **70% of East Boston respondents** cited public transportation as primary mode (highest of all studied communities)
  - Compare: Lynn 28%, Worcester 28%, Springfield 32%
- **82% employment rate** in East Boston (attributed to best transit access of studied towns)
  - Compare: Springfield only 28% employment rate (worst transit access)
- **Low car ownership:** Approximately 1/3 of Chelsea/East Boston residents don't own cars

**Financial Burden:**
- Nearly **40% of respondents sacrifice basic necessities** to afford transportation
- 3 out of 4 respondents agreed: "If public transportation was better, I would drive and/or be driven less"

**Policy Implications:**
- Study demonstrates direct correlation between transit access and employment opportunities
- Residents from communities with better transit access had significantly higher employment rates
- Better transit = improved ability to hold jobs, reach doctor's appointments, provide for families

## 6. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: COMMUNITY vs. AIRPORT EXPANSION

### Airport Expansion Timeline

**1923:** Military airfield opened in East Boston
**1929:** Purchased by city, transitioned to passenger travel
**1960s:** Continued expansion met with resistance from working-class Italian-American community
**1967:** Airport expansion cleared **70 acres of recreation space** including Wood Island Park
- Airport likened to "octopus sprawling across the community, taking up houses, parks"

**Lost Community Resources:**
- Neptune Road
- Amerina Field
- Woodside Park
- Multiple residential areas

### Community Organizing Evolution
- 1960s-70s: Italian-American working-class resistance
- 1980s: Formation of AIR Inc. (1981)
- 1987: First Community Agreement with Massport
- 2000s-present: Now predominantly Latino community
- Organizations like GreenRoots continue EJ fight

### Current Growth Concerns
- **FY 2025:** Logan served 44 million passengers (5% increase over FY 2024) - highest ever
- Community fears continued expansion impacts
- Emphasis on regional airport system as alternative (TF Green, Manchester)

## 7. HOW TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS COULD HELP/HURT EAST BOSTON

### Potential Benefits of Better Kendall-Logan Transit

**Traffic Reduction Through East Boston:**
- Current problem: 12 million TNC rides through East Boston to/from Logan annually
- 5 million deadhead (empty) trips
- Better direct transit (e.g., improved Silver Line, dedicated bus lanes, gondola, etc.) could reduce cars
- Less congestion on Neptune Road, Porter Street, and harbor tunnels
- Reduced diesel truck traffic from North Shore using East Boston as pass-through

**Air Quality Improvements:**
- Mode shift from cars to transit = reduced vehicle emissions
- Fewer idling vehicles in neighborhood
- Particularly important given East Boston's already severe pollution burden
- Could help address 35,000+ lbs daily pollution

**Job Access for East Boston Residents:**
- Better connection to Kendall Square employment hub
- Red-Blue Connector specifically identified as critical for East Boston-Kendall job access
- Suffolk Downs development (10,000 housing units) needs job connectivity
- 82% employment rate in East Boston tied to good transit access - maintain/improve this

**Environmental Justice Principle:**
- East Boston bears pollution burden of airport
- Transit improvements that reduce car traffic = partial mitigation
- Could be positioned as environmental justice remedy

### Potential Concerns/Risks

**Bypass Concerns:**
- If transit improvements only serve airport travelers (not East Boston residents), community doesn't benefit
- Example: Gondola or Silver Line improvements must include East Boston stops, not just direct Kendall-Logan
- Risk of being "transit infrastructure" without being "transit access for residents"

**Gentrification/Displacement:**
- Better transit connections could increase real estate values
- Risk of pricing out existing Latino/immigrant community
- Need affordable housing protections concurrent with transit improvements

**Construction Impacts:**
- Any major transit construction could temporarily worsen conditions
- Noise, disruption, detours during building phase
- Must have strong mitigation during construction

**Massport/Airport Benefit Without Community Benefit:**
- Community concern: improvements serve airport expansion rather than limiting it
- Must not be positioned as enabling more airport growth
- Need explicit commitments that transit improvements don't justify airport expansion

## 8. EQUITY FRAMEWORKS FOR KSA RECOMMENDATIONS

### Massachusetts 2024 Environmental Justice Strategy (EEA/OEJE)

**Key Principles:**
1. **Meaningful Engagement:** Community-led processes designed with and for EJ communities
2. **Project Impact Analysis:** Assess impacts using state mapping/screening tools for EJ neighborhoods
3. **Equity Embedded:** EJ principles integrated throughout planning and implementation
4. **Just Transition:** Equitable path to decarbonized economy

**Application to Airport Access:**
- Any Kendall-Logan transit must undergo EJ impact analysis
- East Boston community must be at table from beginning (not just "public comment")
- Cumulative impact analysis required (new 2024 DEP rule)

### MassDOT Beyond Mobility Plan (July 2024)

**Framework Goals:**
- Safety
- Reliability
- **Equity**
- Sustainability
- Resiliency

**Equity Approach:**
- Recognizes low-income, nonwhite, foreign-born communities "historically overburdened and underserved"
- Transportation equity "part and parcel of everything" MassDOT does
- Use Regional Environmental Justice "Plus" (REJ+) dataset for equity checks
- REJ+ accounts for: race, income, limited English proficiency, age, disability, vehicle availability

**Capital Investment Plan (CIP):**
- Annual analysis of investment distribution between Title VI/EJ communities vs. rest of state
- Geographic distribution analysis

**Application to Airport Access:**
- KSA should frame recommendations using Beyond Mobility equity lens
- Demonstrate how improvements serve historically underserved East Boston
- Show geographic equity in investment distribution

### Federal Justice40 Policy

**Context:**
- 2024 RAISE grant funding prioritizes EJ communities
- MBTA received $22M for Lower Broadway (Everett) bus lanes - collaboration serving "historically disadvantaged communities"
- Federal funding available for projects benefiting EJ populations

**Application to Airport Access:**
- Kendall-Logan improvements could qualify for Justice40 funding IF they demonstrably benefit East Boston
- Position project as reducing emissions in EJ community
- Emphasize safety and access for residents, not just airport travelers

## 10. CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR KSA POLICY MEMO

### Must Address

1. **Explicit EJ Analysis:** Any recommended option must include environmental justice impact assessment
2. **Community Benefit Requirement:** How does each option specifically benefit East Boston residents (not just airport travelers)?
3. **Air Quality Impact:** Quantify emissions reduction from mode shift
4. **Traffic Reduction:** Model reduction in vehicle trips through East Boston neighborhoods
5. **Job Access:** Show improved East Boston-Kendall commute for workers
6. **Suffolk Downs Coordination:** Account for 10,000 new housing units on Blue Line
7. **No Airport Expansion Enablement:** Explicitly state improvements don't justify increasing airport capacity

### Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

**Early Engagement (Before Final Recommendations):**
- Rep. Madaro (Transportation Committee Vice Chair)
- Councilor Coletta (District 1)
- GreenRoots leadership
- AIR Inc.

**Public Process:**
- Meetings in East Boston (not just Cambridge)
- Spanish/multilingual materials and interpretation
- Partner with trusted community organizations
- Multiple formats for input (not just written comments)

### Equity Principles for Recommendations

1. **Community-Designed:** East Boston residents at table from beginning
2. **Burden Reduction:** Prioritize options reducing environmental burden on EJ community
3. **Access Enhancement:** Ensure residents benefit from improved connectivity
4. **No Displacement:** Consider gentrification risks, recommend affordable housing protections
5. **Construction Mitigation:** Strong requirements for minimizing disruption during building
6. **Ongoing Voice:** Community representation in implementation/operations

### Funding & Implementation

**Potential Funding Sources:**
- Federal Justice40 funds (if EJ benefit demonstrated)
- MassDOT CIP (with EJ equity analysis)
- Massport mitigation funds (community agreement)
- Climate/emissions reduction grants

**Community Agreement Model:**
- Follow precedent of 1987 First Community Agreement

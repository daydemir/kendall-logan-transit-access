### Boston-Area Developments

**Key Finding: No Boston-area vertiport proposals found in research.**

Boston not mentioned in any eVTOL deployment plans or vertiport infrastructure announcements as of 2024-2025.

### Operating Economics

**Initial Fare Costs:**
- $100-$300 per trip initially
- Example comparison: $150-$200 for 15-minute eVTOL flight vs. $40-$80 for 45-minute taxi

**Capital Costs:**
- Aircraft: ~$5 million
- Battery replacement over 20-year life: $13 million (~$1M/year, $500/hour)
- Per-passenger capital cost (4 passengers, 75% load factor, 20-25 min flight): ~$70

**Operating Costs:**
- Full operating costs: ~$200 per passenger for short flight
- Operating costs: $250-$400 per hour
- Daily operating costs: $1,000-$2,000 for 4-5 flight hours

**Per-Mile Economics:**
- Joby estimate: $3.80 per mile (25-mile trip)
- Lilium estimate: $4.40 per mile (Manhattan to JFK at $70 total)
- Comparison: Helicopter trips currently $9/mile

**Cost Projections:**
- L.E.K. Consulting: eVTOL costs per passenger-km will decrease by 2/3 between 2025-2040
- Major cost components: Pilot salaries, energy costs, maintenance/repair/overhaul

**Economic Constraints:**
- High battery replacement costs are "major gotcha"
- Capacity limited to 2-5 passengers per trip
- Profitability dependent on automation and economies of scale

### Market Outlook

**Timeline:**
- Commercial services may commence in next 2-3 years
- **Will not reach scale until mid-2030s**
- Unlikely to become mass-market mode of travel
- Target market: Business and mid-to-high income individuals, expedited cargo

### Kendall Rooftop Vertiport Analysis

**Technical Considerations:**
- MIT and Kendall Square buildings could theoretically support rooftop vertiports
- Would need structural assessment, FAA approval, community engagement
- Noise concerns significant in dense urban environment

**Regulatory Hurdles:**
- No vertiport infrastructure in Massachusetts
- Would need to establish first in region
- Competing with other cities already advancing plans

**Economic Reality:**
- At $150-$300 per trip, limited market for Kendall-Logan connection
- Alternative: Logan rooftop to downtown Manhattan more economically viable use case

### Realistic Timeline for Kendall-Logan

**2025-2030: Not Feasible**
- No Boston-area vertiport infrastructure
- No operator interest announced
- Limited certification progress
- Operating economics don't support short 2-mile route

**2030-2035: Highly Unlikely**
- Even optimistic projections show limited scale by mid-2030s
- Boston not in first wave of deployments
- Cost per passenger ($200+) far exceeds value for 2-mile trip

**2035+: Possible But Impractical**
- Technology mature but economics still challenged
- Better use cases: Logan to downtown Boston, Logan to Worcester/Providence
- Kendall-Logan too short a distance to justify eVTOL

### Recommendations

**Do not pursue eVTOL for Kendall-Logan connection.** Route too short, no supporting infrastructure, no operator interest, economics unfavorable. Boston may see eVTOL service for longer routes (Logan-downtown, regional connections) but not for Kendall Square first/last mile.

## 3. Microtransit / On-Demand Services

### Successful Models

**Via Transit:**
- Operating successful partnerships with Worcester Regional Transit Authority (WRTA) in Massachusetts
- WRTA received $459,430 in discretionary MassDOT funding for Via partnership pilot
- Global operations in multiple cities

**MBTA On-Demand Paratransit:**
- Fall 2016: Began on-demand paratransit pilot with Uber/Lyft for 400 registered users
- Rider pays first $2, MBTA subsidizes up to $40 (rider responsible for amounts over $42)
- **Results:** 
  - Ridership increased from 10 to 13 trips per person per month
  - Cost decreased from $30/trip to $9/trip
  - Program extended to all registered paratransit users
- December 2024: New contract with Spare for paratransit technology and services

**Kansas City Area Transit Authority (KCATA):**
- Relaunched program after unsuccessful 2016 pilot
- Micro-transit ridership now 15x higher than 2016 pilot
- Schedules/routes adjust based on demand
- Wait times under 15 minutes

### The Bridj Failure: Critical Lessons

**Background:**
- Founded 2014, launched in Boston, Austin, Washington DC
- Used data (census, Facebook check-ins) to create dynamic transportation routes
- "Luxury bus service" targeting underserved areas
- Ceased operations April 2017

**Business Model Issues:**
- **Capital-intensive:** Owned and operated own vans, employees (not contractor drivers like Uber/Lyft)
- **Pricing:** Charged ~$5 per seat (2x MBTA bus fare) - not enough to cover overhead
- **High operating costs:** No public subsidies in Boston operations

**Operational Failures:**

**Kansas City Pilot ($1.3M, 1 year):**
- Served only 1,480 people in full year
- Six months in: Fewer than 600 rides (vs. 200/day projected)
- **Cost per ride: ~$1,000** (with public subsidy)
- Users: Younger and wealthier than typical KC resident
- Feedback: Service not robust enough to be useful

**Product Problems:**
- "Fancy bus stuck in traffic with everyone else" - Former MA Transportation Secretary Jim Aloisi
- Vast gulf between algorithmic promise and reality
- Fixed-route service with smartphone app, despite "on-demand" branding
- Failed to fulfill core promise of mobility transformation

**Downfall:**
- Attempted acquisition by major car company (rumored Toyota) fell through
- Without acquisition, business model unsustainable
- Acquired by Australia's Transit Systems, re-launched in Australia/Singapore

**Key Lessons:**
1. **On-demand availability and reliability central to microtransit value** - must be core from day one
2. **Public transit requires subsidy** - fares cannot cover all costs; capital-intensive private models fail
3. **Labor costs dominant** - owning vehicles and employing drivers dramatically increases overhead
4. **Service must be robust** - limited hours/routes make it "not useful enough"
5. **Algorithmic optimization alone insufficient** - still stuck in traffic, real-world constraints apply

### Massachusetts Regional Transit Authority (RTA) Microtransit

**Starting 2019, several RTAs piloted microtransit:**
- CATA On Demand
- CATCH Connect
- FRTA Access
- GATRA GO
- SmartDART
- Via WRTA (Worcester)

MBTA and 15 RTAs provide fixed-route and paratransit service across Massachusetts.

### Airport Last-Mile Applicability

**Successful Airport Microtransit Characteristics:**
- Dedicated, predictable service hours matching flight schedules
- Clear origin/destination pairs (airport terminals to specific Kendall locations)
- Integration with flight tracking for demand prediction
- Premium pricing justifiable for airport convenience
- Partnership with public transit agency or airport authority for subsidy/support

**Risks Based on Bridj Lessons:**
- Cannot be "stuck in traffic" - needs dedicated lanes or TSP
- Must have sufficient service frequency to be reliable
- Requires public subsidy if operated as public benefit
- Technology alone won't overcome fundamental constraints

### Realistic Timeline for Kendall-Logan

**2025-2026: Possible Pilot (1-2 years)**
- Partner with established provider (Via, Spare, not new startup)
- Leverage MBTA/Massport relationship
- Seek MassDOT discretionary funding (similar to WRTA's $459K)
- Start with limited hours (peak commute, major flight banks)
- Integrate with existing transit (not replacement)

**Cost Estimates:**
- Via/Spare partnership: $300,000-$500,000 for 1-year pilot
- Subsidy per ride: Target $5-$10 (not Bridj's $1,000)
- Fare: $8-$12 per trip (competitive with TNC, premium over transit)

**Success Factors:**
- Wait times <10 minutes
- Service hours 5am-11pm minimum
- Integration with MBTA fare payment
- Dedicated pick-up/drop-off locations in Kendall
- Real-time tracking and reliability

### Recommendations

**Near-term (2025-2027):** 
- Pursue microtransit pilot with established operator (Via or Spare)
- Require proven technology platform, not new startup
- Secure MassDOT funding
- Partner with MBTA and Massport
- Learn from Bridj failure: Ensure service is frequent, reliable, fast enough to be useful

**Do not:**
- Launch with unproven startup
- Attempt to own/operate vehicles directly
- Rely on technology alone without addressing traffic congestion
- Underfund service leading to infrequent/unreliable operations

# Red-Blue Connector Analysis

**Timeline**: Medium-term (5-10 years)
**Cost**: $850 million
**Status**: Funded through 30% design, construction 2028-2031

---

## Overview

The Red-Blue Connector extends the Blue Line 0.4 miles west from Bowdoin to Charles/MGH, creating a direct Red-Blue transfer.

## For Kendall-Logan: Honest Assessment

### Time Savings
| Route | Current | With Connector |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Red → Silver Line (via South Station) | ~40 min | Still ~40 min |
| Red → Blue (via Downtown) | 45+ min (3 transfers) | ~25-30 min (1 transfer) |

**Improvement**: 15-20 minutes saved vs current Blue Line routing.

### The Catch
- Silver Line from Logan is **FREE** - Red-Blue costs $2.40
- Both routes still require Airport Station shuttle to terminals
- If tunnel traffic is rarely bad (your anecdotal experience), reliability advantage is smaller

**Bottom line for Kendall airport access**: Modest improvement (~10-15 min), not transformative.

## Broader Boston Benefits (Stronger Case)

### Primary Beneficiaries
1. **East Boston/Revere/Chelsea → Kendall/Cambridge jobs**
   - Current: Blue → Gov't Center → Green → Park → Red (2-3 transfers, 40+ min)
   - With connector: Blue → Charles/MGH → Red (1 transfer, ~20 min)
   - **This is the strongest equity argument**

2. **Suffolk Downs development access**
   - 10,000 housing units, 25,000 jobs on Blue Line
   - Connector gives Red Line riders direct access

3. **Medical complex access**
   - MGH/Mass Eye and Ear at Charles/MGH
   - Blue Line communities get better hospital access

### Ridership Projections
- 1987 study: 9,030 daily trips
- 2010 study: 18,940 daily trips (2030 projection)
- No post-COVID update (remote work impact unknown)

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Arguments Against
| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Cost per mile | $2.1 billion/mile (among highest in US) |
| MBTA backlog | $24.5 billion state-of-good-repair needs |
| 30+ years delayed | Promised as Big Dig mitigation in 1990 |
| Remote work | 2010 projections don't account for hybrid work |

### Arguments For
| Benefit | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Equity | Connects EJ communities (East Boston, Revere, Chelsea) to jobs |
| Network completeness | Only two lines without direct connection |
| Overcrowding relief | Reduces transfers at Downtown Crossing, Park Street |
| Reliability | Rail is more reliable than Silver Line in traffic |

## Political Status

### Supporters
- Fred Salvucci: "The need for this is urgent"
- TransitMatters
- Boston City Council
- Chelsea, East Boston advocates

### Current Funding
- 30% design: Funded
- Construction ($850M): Not yet funded
- Target completion: 2031

---

## Relationship to Other Projects

### Complements Shuttle
- Red-Blue is 5-7 years away
- Shuttle provides immediate relief
- Both can coexist (shuttle for speed, Red-Blue for reliability)

### Depends on Nothing
- Standalone project
- Doesn't require NSRL or Grand Junction

### Enables Future
- If Bowdoin closes, Red-Blue transfer becomes primary Blue Line access from Red Line

---

## Recommendation for KSA

### Position
- **Support Red-Blue Connector** but don't position as primary airport solution
- Frame honestly: "modest improvement for Kendall, major equity benefit for Blue Line communities"
- Push for **construction funding** as part of MBTA capital plan

### Coalition Building
Build support by emphasizing equity:
- East Boston community groups (GreenRoots, AIR Inc.)
- Chelsea advocates
- Environmental groups (CLF originally sued for this)
- Medical community (MGH access)

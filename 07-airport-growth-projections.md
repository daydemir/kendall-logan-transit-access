**Key Finding**: Massachusetts is ALREADY BEHIND SCHEDULE on new airport planning
**Critical Date**: Logan hits capacity ~2032 (7 years away)
**Lead Time for New Airport**: 15-25 years

---

## Current State (2024-2025)

### Logan Statistics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Annual passengers (FY2025) | 44 million (record high) |
| Design capacity (1977) | 25.5 million |
| Current utilization | **170% of design capacity** |
| Growth rate (2012-2019) | ~5% annually |
| Post-pandemic recovery | 3-4% annually |

### Capacity Constraints
| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Runways | 6 runways, ~120 operations/hour max |
| Land | 2,400 acres, cannot expand (surrounded by water) |
| Terminals | Modernization ongoing but doesn't add capacity |
| Ground access | Already maxed on curbside |
| Airspace | Shared with Providence, Manchester, military |
| Parking | Hard-capped at 20,938 spaces by DEP regulation |

## Ground Access & Mode Share (2024)

### Current Mode Share
| Mode | Share | Volume |
|------|-------|--------|
| Rideshare (Uber/Lyft) | **~30%** | ~13M passengers; 3.6M pickups (2023) |
| Taxi | ~2-3% | 1M+ pickups (2023), down from 2M (2017) |
| Transit (Blue/Silver Line) | Not published | Silver Line free from airport |
| Private car/parking | Unknown | Capped at 20,938 spaces |
| Logan Express | Small | Massport aims to "double" capacity |

### Ground Access Congestion
Per Fred Salvucci (former MassDOT Secretary), January 2024:
- **Curbside**: "chaos" - parking, Logan Express, rideshare demand "regularly exceeds capacity"
- **Runways/taxiways**: "close to capacity and will require reprioritization"
- **Roadways**: "increasingly choking with traffic"
- **Key constraint**: Logan is closer to downtown than any US airport except San Diego

### Rideshare Growth
| Year | Rideshare Pickups | Taxi Pickups |
|------|-------------------|--------------|
| 2017 | Growing | ~2M |
| 2019 | Dominant | ~1.5M |
| 2023 | 3.6M | ~1M |
| 2024 | ~13M passengers used rideshare | Rebounding |

Massport raised rideshare fees to $7.50/trip (2025) - highest in the country - to manage demand and fund transit alternatives.

## Growth Projections

### Scenarios to 2075
| Year | Low (2% CAGR) | Medium (3.5% CAGR) | High (5% CAGR) |
|------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 2025 | 44M | 44M | 44M |
| 2030 | 49M | 53M | 56M |
| 2035 | 54M | 63M | 71M |
| 2040 | 59M | 74M | 91M |
| 2050 | 72M | 104M | 148M |
| 2075 | 116M | 241M | 502M |

### Hard Capacity Ceiling
**Logan's maximum capacity: 55-60 million passengers**

| Scenario | Hits Capacity | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| High (5%) | 2029 | 4 years away |
| Medium (3.5%) | 2032 | 7 years away |
| Low (2%) | 2037 | 12 years away |

## National and Global Trends

### US Aviation Growth
| Source | Projection | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| FAA Aerospace Forecast | **2.0-2.2% CAGR** | US RPMs through 2040 |
| IATA 20-Year Forecast (2024) | **3.0-3.1% CAGR** | North America/US specific |
| IATA Global | 3.6% CAGR | Skewed by Africa (4.2%), Middle East (4.1%) |

*Note: The 2-3% range is most defensible for Boston/US projections.*

### Remote Work Impact
**Counter-intuitive finding**: Remote work is INCREASING total air travel
- "Workations" and distributed teams drive new demand
- Reduced commuting but increased long-distance travel
- Business travel spending heading to $2 trillion by 2028

### Climate Policy Impact
- Will increase costs via carbon pricing
- May shift some short-haul to rail
- But won't stop growth - 3.6% global CAGR projected through 2050
- Electric aviation: eVTOLs by 2030s, but limited impact on major hubs until 2050+

### HSR Competition
- If Boston-NYC/DC high-speed rail built: ~2.3M passengers could shift to trains
- But **no funded project exists**
- Would reduce pressure but not solve capacity problem

## Regional Airport Context

### Current System
| Airport | Passengers | Ratio to Logan |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| Logan (BOS) | 44M | 1x |
| Manchester (MHT) | 1.27M | 1/35th |
| T.F. Green (PVD) | 3.2M | 1/14th |
| Worcester (ORH) | 229K | 1/190th |

### Regional Airports Cannot Absorb Logan Overflow
- Combined regional capacity: ~10M passengers
- Logan projected to need 50M+ by 2035
- Gap: 40M passengers with nowhere to go

### Regional Coordination Proposal
- Model: NY-NJ Port Authority
- Coordinate Logan, Manchester, T.F. Green, Worcester, Bradley
- No active legislation
- Would help but doesn't solve capacity problem

## When New Airport Becomes Necessary

### Threshold Analysis
| Trigger | Passenger Level | When Reached |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Ground access gridlock | 50M | ~2029-2032 |
| Runway capacity exhausted | 55-60M | ~2032-2037 |
| Terminal impossible to expand | Already there | Now |

### Lead Time for New Airport
| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Site selection | 2-5 years |
| Environmental review | 3-5 years |
| Design | 2-4 years |
| Construction | 5-8 years |
| **Total** | **12-22 years** |
| With opposition | **25-35 years** |

### Historical Precedents
| Airport | Planning to Opening |
|---------|---------------------|
| Denver International | 12 years (fastest major airport) |
| Munich | 23 years |
| Berlin Brandenburg | 35+ years (with delays) |

## Critical Finding: Massachusetts Is Behind Schedule

### The Math
| Scenario | Logan Hits Capacity | New Airport Opens (if started now) | Gap |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|-----|
| Medium | 2032 | 2040-2050 | 8-18 years of severe congestion |
| High | 2029 | 2040-2050 | 11-21 years of severe congestion |
| Low | 2037 | 2045-2050 | 8-13 years of severe congestion |

**Even in the best case, Massachusetts faces 8+ years of severe capacity constraints.**

### Implications
| If Planning Starts | Airport Opens | Gap Years |
|--------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 2025 (now) | 2040-2050 | 8-18 years |
| 2030 | 2045-2055 | 13-23 years |
| 2035 | 2050-2060 | 18-28 years |

**Every year of delay = another year of severe congestion.**

## Demand Shifts to Monitor

### Factors That Could Reduce Growth
| Factor | Impact | Likelihood |
|--------|--------|------------|
| High-speed rail (Boston-NYC) | -5-10% of total | Low (not funded) |
| Carbon pricing | -3-5% | Medium |
| Remote work | Net positive currently | Uncertain |
| Recession | Temporary dip | Cyclical |

### Factors That Could Increase Growth
| Factor | Impact | Likelihood |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Population growth | +1-2%/year | High |
| Economic development (biotech, tech) | +2-3%/year | High |
| International route expansion | +1-2%/year | Medium |
| Climate migration to Northeast | Unknown | Possible long-term |

## Recommendation

### For Policy Memo
1. **Sound the alarm**: Logan hits capacity in ~7 years; new airport takes 15-25 years
2. **Advocate for immediate planning**: Even conservative scenarios require starting now
3. **Frame as inevitability**: Not "if" but "when" - the question is whether we're prepared
4. **Quantify the cost of delay**: Each year = another year of congestion, lost economic activity

### Key Message
> "Logan Airport will hit capacity around 2032. A new airport takes 15-25 years to build. If we don't start planning now, Massachusetts faces 10-20 years of severe airport congestion that will harm economic competitiveness and quality of life."

# Alternative Airports for Kendall Square: Medium-Term Solutions Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines four regional airports (Worcester, Manchester, Providence, and Hanscom) as potential alternatives to Logan for Kendall Square travelers in a 5-15 year timeframe. Key findings:

- **Manchester-Boston Regional (MHT)** offers the most robust current service with 1.3M passengers (2024), competitive pricing, and growing route network, but lacks direct rail connection
- **Providence/T.F. Green (PVD)** provides excellent Amtrak connectivity but no direct airport station access
- **Worcester Regional (ORH)** is closest to potential rail improvements but has limited service (204K passengers projected 2024)
- **Hanscom Field (BED)** faces severe political constraints that make commercial expansion unlikely
- **Regional coordination** through a Port Authority-style model could optimize the system but lacks political momentum

**Critical Gap**: Kendall Square workers likely travel to tech hubs (SF, Seattle, NYC) and biotech conference cities - routes poorly served by regional alternatives currently.

- **Current commercial service: NONE** (as of 2024)
- Last scheduled service: Southern Airways Express to Nantucket (May 2021-~2022)

**Historical Context:**
- Primarily general aviation and corporate aircraft
- 20 miles northwest of Boston
- Large general aviation airport (region's largest)
- Small fraction of use serves public purpose

**Infrastructure:**
- Adequate runway and facilities for limited commercial service within size restrictions
- Nearby to Kendall Square (closer than Logan by road distance)
- No rail connection

### Political Constraints

**Expansion Opposition (2024-2025):**

**Massport Proposal:**
- Add 500,000+ square feet of private jet hangar space
- Accommodate growing private aviation demand

**Opposition Coalition:**
- Descendants of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau
- Leading historians, scientists, environmentalists
- State Senator Michael Barrett (climate committee co-chair)
- Local town governments (Lexington, Bedford, Concord, Lincoln)

**Opposition Arguments:**
1. **Historical significance**: 
   - Near Minuteman National Historical Park
   - Steps from "shot heard 'round the world" location
   - 250th anniversary of Lexington/Concord battles
   
2. **Environmental impact**:
   - 106,676 tons of carbon emissions over 18 months (pre-expansion)
   - Private jets pollute 10-20x more per passenger than commercial
   - Adjacent to Great Meadows National Wildlife Refuge
   
3. **Local quality of life**:
   - Noise pollution
   - Traffic impacts
   - Air quality concerns
   
4. **MEPA Review**:
   - Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act Office rejected draft EIR (June 2024)
   - Did not adequately address environmental impacts
   - Requested better analysis

**Town Position:**
- All surrounding towns adopted same guiding principles (unanimous town meeting votes)
- Communities view themselves as rural residential with responsibility to protect natural/historic resources
- Airport's 1947 creation was controversial (passed legislature by single vote)

**Current Status (2024-2025):**
- Governor Maura Healey urged to stop expansion
- Rally against expansion held at State House steps
- Public opposition organized and vocal
- Project under MEPA review

### Corporate Aviation Current State

**Primary Use:**
- Business executives seeking easy access to Eastern Massachusetts
- Private and corporate aircraft of all sizes
- Popular choice for avoiding Logan congestion
- No scheduled passenger service

**Constraints on Commercial Expansion:**
1. **Regulatory**: 60-seat limit on commercial aircraft
2. **Political**: Extremely strong local opposition
3. **Environmental**: Protected lands and historical sites adjacent
4. **Infrastructure**: No public transit connection
5. **Historical**: Controversial since inception (1947)

**Likelihood of Commercial Service Expansion:**
- **Very Low** for foreseeable future (5-15 years)
- Private aviation expansion also highly contested
- Any commercial service would be severely limited by 60-seat rule
- Political environment makes expansion nearly impossible

## 5. Regional Airport Coordination

### Proposals for New England Airport Authority

**Boston Globe Opinion Piece (August 2025):**
- Proposes three-airport cooperative system: Logan (BOS), T.F. Green (PVD), Manchester (MHT)
- Current state: Airports operate independently and competitively
- Problem: Air service policies driven by individual airport finances rather than regional transportation needs
- Goal: Distribute passenger load without overburdening any single airport

**Proposed Governance Model:**
- Pattern: New York-New Jersey Port Authority Compact of 1921
- Structure: Commissioners from each participating state (equal representation)
- For New England: Representatives from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire
- Precedent: NY-NJ Port Authority successfully operates 5 airports (JFK, Newark, LaGuardia, Teterboro, Stewart)

**Rationale:**
- Logan: 44 million passengers (FY2025), 5% increase, highest ever
- Logan environmental impact: 15 tons harmful pollutants daily
- Disproportionate impact on environmental justice communities
- Significant noise affecting thousands of residents
- Regional airports underutilized (combined serve <2.3M vs Logan's 44M)

**Current Status:**
- Opinion/proposal stage only
- No official government initiative
- No legislative action
- No interstate negotiations reported

### NY-NJ Port Authority Model

**Structure:**
- Established: 1921 via interstate compact authorized by Congress
- Governance: Board of 12 Commissioners (6 from NY, 6 from NJ)
- Appointments: Each governor appoints 6, with state senate consent
- Terms: Overlapping 6-year terms
- Self-supporting: No tax dollars, funded by tolls/fees/rents

**Scope:**
- Airports: JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, Teterboro, Stewart
- Also: Bridges, tunnels, Port Authority Bus Terminal, PATH rail, seaports
- Jurisdiction: 25-mile radius of Statue of Liberty
- Mandate: Any transport project promoting commerce, trade, public good

**Financial Model:**
- Bond issuance backed by consistent revenue streams
- Self-supporting operation
- Can raise vast sums for capital projects
- Recent: $45 billion capital plan 2026-2035 ($20.7B for aviation)

**Advantages:**
- Coordinated regional planning
- Cross-subsidization of underperforming facilities
- Unified governance despite multi-state complexity
- Economies of scale
- Long-term planning capability

**Historical Success:**
- One of oldest/largest public authorities in US
- Model for other multi-state authorities
- Managed complex aviation growth since 1947 (took over LaGuardia)
- Successfully coordinates competing interests across state lines

### Applicability to New England

**Political Feasibility Challenges:**
1. **Three states vs. two**: More complex than NY-NJ
2. **Airport ownership**: 
   - Logan: Massport (Massachusetts state authority)
   - MHT: City of Manchester, NH
   - PVD: Rhode Island Airport Corporation
3. **State interests diverge**: Each state wants local airport success
4. **Revenue sharing concerns**: Massachusetts may resist subsidizing NH/RI airports
5. **Governance disputes**: Allocation of commissioner seats, decision-making power

**Current Momentum:**
- **None detected** in official channels
- Only opinion pieces, no legislative proposals
- No governor-level discussions reported
- No feasibility studies commissioned

**FAA Regional Coordination:**
- FAA New England Region coordinates safety/planning
- Not a governance authority
- Single Site initiative at Logan (Core 30 airport)
- Does not coordinate commercial scheduling/pricing

**What Would Be Required:**
1. Interstate compact negotiations
2. State legislature approval (MA, NH, RI)
3. Congressional authorization
4. Agreement on governance structure
5. Transfer or lease of airport control
6. Financial framework establishment
7. Addressing Massport's existing role

**Timeframe if Pursued:**
- Negotiation: 2-3 years minimum
- Legislative approval: 1-2 years
- Implementation: 2-3 years
- **Total: 5-8 years minimum** (likely longer given complexity)

- Cost: Unknown (CRISI grant of $2.8M for planning only)
- Current status: Planning phase for track electrification and station improvements
- Would enable Amtrak Acela/Northeast Regional to stop at airport
- Currently only MBTA commuter rail serves airport (weekday only)

**Benefits for Airport Access:**
- Dramatic improvement: 37-minute Acela from airport to Boston South Station
- Airport to Kendall via Red Line: ~45-50 minutes total
- Comparable to Logan access time
- PVD has decent service but still missing West Coast routes

**Challenges:**
- Requires track electrification (significant cost)
- Station platform improvements
- Amtrak schedule integration
- Currently only planning funded, not construction

**Timeline if Fully Funded:**
- Complete planning/design: 1-2 years
- Environmental review: 1 year
- Construction (electrification + station): 2-3 years
- **Total: 4-6 years minimum**

### Cost Comparison: Regional Rail vs. Logan Access Improvements

**Regional Airport Rail Improvements:**

| Project | Cost | Benefit to Kendall | Airport Service Level |
|---------|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Grand Junction to Worcester Line | $300-400M | High (direct Kendall connection) | Low (ORH very limited) |
| Capitol Corridor to Manchester | $159-200M | Medium (requires connection to Lowell Line) | Medium (MHT good East Coast, no West Coast) |
| T.F. Green Amtrak Service | Unknown (>$100M est.) | Medium (via Boston connection) | Medium (PVD decent but not comprehensive) |
| **Total Regional Approach** | **~$600-700M+** | **Serves <50% of travel needs** | **Missing critical West Coast routes** |

**Logan Access Improvements (for comparison):**

| Project | Cost | Benefit to Kendall | Airport Service Level |
|---------|------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Red-Blue Connector | ~$850M (2024 est.) | Low-Medium (helps Airport station access) | Excellent (Logan full service) |
| North-South Rail Link | ~$6-12B (est.) | High (connects commuter rails via downtown) | Excellent (Logan full service) |
| Grand Junction (connects North & South stations via Kendall) | $300-400M | Very High (direct Kendall to multiple commuter lines) | Excellent (Logan full service via Silver Line) |
| Improved Silver Line to Kendall | <$50M | Low (still requires transfer) | Excellent (Logan full service) |

**Value Proposition Analysis:**

**Regional Airports Approach ($600-700M):**
- Pros:
  - Distributes congestion
  - Lower parking costs
  - Easier terminal navigation
  - Political benefit of supporting regional economies
  
- Cons:
  - Serves only ~40-50% of Kendall travel needs
  - Completely misses critical West Coast routes (SF, Seattle, LA, SD)
  - Requires behavior change from travelers
  - Multiple rail projects needed to be effective
  - Interstate political complexity (NH Capitol Corridor)
  - Airlines may not add routes even with rail access

**Logan Improvements Approach (Various options):**
- Pros:
  - Serves 100% of travel needs (comprehensive route network)
  - Benefits all Boston-area travelers, not just airport users
  - Some projects (Grand Junction) serve multiple purposes
  - Established airport with airline commitment
  
- Cons:
  - More expensive for comprehensive solution (NSRL)
  - Grand Junction alone ($300-400M) doesn't solve all access issues
  - Red-Blue Connector expensive with limited Kendall benefit
  - Doesn't address Logan congestion/environmental issues

**Best Value for Kendall:**

1. **Grand Junction Line ($300-400M)**:
   - Direct Kendall connection to Worcester commuter line
   - Can access Logan via connection to South Station
   - Enables future western airport location
   - Multi-purpose benefit (not just airport)
   - Political feasibility: Medium (Cambridge opposition)

2. **Regional airports as supplement, not replacement**:
   - MHT via Capitol Corridor: Good for East Coast travel
   - But cannot replace Logan for West Coast (critical gap)

### Political Feasibility Assessment

**Grand Junction (MA only):**
- **Feasibility: Medium**
- Pros: Single state, benefits Boston/Cambridge corridor
- Cons: Cambridge local opposition (grade crossings)
- Timeline: Could advance with sufficient political will
- Recent momentum: 2024 study shows renewed interest

**Capitol Corridor (MA-NH):**
- **Feasibility: Low**
- Pros: Benefits both states
- Cons: Interstate complexity, NH funding reluctance, stalled for years
- Timeline: No current path forward
- Recent momentum: None (studies ongoing but no funding)

**T.F. Green Amtrak (MA-RI-Federal):**
- **Feasibility: Medium-Low**
- Pros: Federal CRISI grant shows interest, benefits RI economic development
- Cons: Requires federal, RI, and Amtrak coordination; track electrification expensive
- Timeline: In planning phase but no construction timeline
- Recent momentum: $2.8M planning grant (2024) is positive signal

**Regional Airport Authority (MA-NH-RI):**
- **Feasibility: Very Low**
- Pros: Rational coordination model (NY-NJ precedent)
- Cons: Three-state complexity, revenue sharing disputes, airport ownership conflicts
- Timeline: 5-8 years minimum if pursued (not currently pursued)
- Recent momentum: None (opinion pieces only, no official action)

**Red-Blue Connector (MA only):**
- **Feasibility: Medium-High**
- Pros: Single state, long-studied, political support exists
- Cons: Expensive (~$850M), limited Kendall benefit, competing MBTA priorities
- Timeline: Frequently proposed, never funded
- Recent momentum: Ongoing advocacy but no funding commitment

**Assessment for Medium-Term (5-15 years):**

**Most Likely to Advance:**
1. **Grand Junction**: Study completed (2024), single state, multi-purpose benefit
2. **Incremental MHT service improvements**: Airlines adding routes without rail (JetBlue 2025)
3. **T.F. Green planning**: Planning funded, but construction uncertain

**Unlikely to Advance:**
1. **Capitol Corridor**: Stalled, interstate complexity, no funding path
2. **Regional Authority**: No political momentum whatsoever
3. **Red-Blue Connector**: Perpetually proposed, never funded

**Pragmatic Medium-Term Outlook:**
- Regional airports will grow modestly through airline incentive programs
- Rail connections unlikely except possibly Grand Junction (benefits beyond airport access)
- Kendall travelers will continue to rely primarily on Logan
- Regional airports may capture 15-25% of travel (mostly leisure/Florida, some East Coast business)
- Critical West Coast routes will remain Logan-dependent

## 8. Incentivizing Kendall Travelers to Use Alternatives

### Current Barriers

**Time Penalty:**
- MHT: +30-60 min access time vs Logan
- ORH: +15-45 min access time vs Logan (driving), but inadequate service
- PVD: +30-60 min access time vs Logan
- **For time-sensitive business travelers**: Unacceptable without significant cost savings or service improvement

**Service Limitations:**
- No direct West Coast service from any alternative
- Requires connections for most business destinations
- Added time: 1-3 hours for connection vs. direct
- **For frequent travelers**: Extra connection time > access time savings

**Frequency:**
- Logan: Multiple daily flights to major cities
- Alternatives: 1-2 daily (or less) to limited destinations
- Missed flight: 4-6 hour delay at alternatives vs. 1-2 hours at Logan
- **For schedule flexibility**: Logan strongly preferred

### Potential Incentive Mechanisms

**Financial Incentives:**

1. **Corporate Travel Policy Incentives:**
   - Pay grade differential: Extra $100-200 allowance for regional airport use
   - Parking reimbursement: MHT parking ($14/day) + $20/day bonus = $34/day vs. Logan out-of-pocket
   - Time compensation: Pay for extra 1-2 hours as work time
   - **Feasibility**: Medium - companies could implement individually
   - **Impact**: Small - unlikely to overcome service gaps

2. **Kendall Square Association Vouchers:**
   - $50-100 voucher for MHT/PVD use
   - Partner with airlines for additional discounts
   - Funded by KSA or member companies
   - **Feasibility**: Medium - requires KSA coordination
   - **Impact**: Small - one-time savings insufficient for behavior change

3. **Airport Tax/Fee Differential:**
   - Reduce passenger facility charges at regional airports
   - Increase Logan fees (politically difficult)
   - Use revenue to subsidize regional airport shuttles
   - **Feasibility**: Low - requires Massport/state action, may violate regulations
   - **Impact**: Minimal - $5-10 fee difference won't change behavior

**Service Improvements:**

1. **Dedicated Kendall Square Shuttle:**
   - Direct coach service: Kendall Square to MHT/PVD
   - Frequency: Every 60-90 minutes during peak travel times
   - Cost: Free or subsidized ($10-20)
   - Travel time: 60-75 min to MHT, 75-90 min to PVD
   - **Cost to operate**: $1-2M annually (estimate)
   - **Feasibility**: Medium - requires KSA or Massport funding
   - **Impact**: Medium - improves access but doesn't solve route limitations

2. **Premium Lounge/Services:**
   - Kendall Square travelers get free lounge access at MHT/PVD
   - Priority boarding, free checked bags
   - Partnership with airlines serving regional airports
   - **Cost**: $200-500K annually (estimated)
   - **Feasibility**: Medium - requires airline partnerships
   - **Impact**: Small - premium services nice but don't overcome time/route issues

**Route Development:**

1. **Subsidized West Coast Route:**
   - Pay airline to operate Kendall-priority route (e.g., MHT-SFO)
   - Minimum revenue guarantee for 2-3 years
   - Target: 1 daily flight to SF or Seattle from MHT
   - **Cost**: $5-10M annually (based on typical revenue guarantees)
   - **Feasibility**: Low-Medium - requires major funding commitment
   - **Impact**: High IF implemented - solves critical service gap

2. **Chicago Hub Enhancement:**
   - MHT already has Southwest to Chicago
   - Subsidize additional frequencies
   - Improve connections to West Coast via Chicago
   - **Cost**: $2-5M annually
   - **Feasibility**: Medium - builds on existing service
   - **Impact**: Medium - helps but adds connection time

**Behavior Change Campaigns:**

1. **Kendall Square "Fly Local" Campaign:**
   - Marketing push emphasizing time savings (parking, security)
   - Focus on appropriate routes (NYC, DC, Florida)
   - Educate on when MHT makes sense
   - **Cost**: $100-300K annually
   - **Feasibility**: High - easy to implement
   - **Impact**: Small - only works for routes already well-served

2. **Carbon Offset Program:**
   - Kendall companies emphasize sustainability
   - Regional airports = less congestion = lower per-passenger emissions (debatable)
   - Market to environmentally conscious travelers
   - **Cost**: Minimal (messaging only)
   - **Feasibility**: High
   - **Impact**: Very Small - insufficient motivation

### Most Promising Approaches

**Realistic Impact (5-15 years):**

1. **Shuttle Service to MHT** ($1-2M/year):
   - Improves access time
   - Makes MHT competitive for East Coast, Florida routes
   - Could capture 10-15% of Kendall travel
   - Limitation: Still doesn't solve West Coast problem

2. **Route Subsidy for Critical Gap** ($5-10M for 2-3 years):
   - MHT-SFO or MHT-Seattle daily flight
   - Game-changing for tech industry if implemented
   - Could capture 20-30% of Kendall travel
   - Risk: Airline may discontinue after subsidy ends
   - Political challenge: Why subsidize one industry's travel?

3. **Behavior Campaign + Corporate Incentives** ($200-500K/year):
   - Target right travelers for right routes
   - NYC, DC, Florida via MHT/PVD
   - Combined with corporate $50-100 incentive
   - Could capture 5-10% of Kendall travel
   - Low cost, low risk

**Fundamental Challenge:**

No amount of incentives can overcome the service gap for West Coast destinations. Unless airlines add direct San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, or San Diego service to regional airports, Kendall's tech and biotech travelers will remain Logan-dependent for 40-50% of their trips.

**Break-Even Analysis:**

For a Kendall traveler to switch from Logan to MHT:

Current state:
- Logan: 20 min drive, $32 parking, direct flight to SFO (6 hours)
- MHT: 65 min drive, $14 parking, no direct SFO service (requires connection, 8-10 hours total)

With incentives:
- Free shuttle (save 20-30 min vs. driving + parking)
- $100 voucher
- Free lounge access

Time value:
- Business traveler time: ~$75-150/hour (typical corporate rate)
- Extra time for connection: 2-4 hours
- Value of time lost: $150-600
- Savings from incentives: ~$100-150

**Result**: Incentives don't come close to compensating for time lost on connections. Only direct service can compete.

---

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Current State Summary

**Airport Passenger Distribution (2024):**
- Logan: 44 million (70% of New England traffic)
- Manchester: 1.3 million
- Providence: <2019 levels (not specified, but significantly lower than Logan)
- Worcester: ~204,000

**Service to Key Kendall Destinations:**
- San Francisco/Bay Area: ONLY Logan
- Seattle: ONLY Logan
- Los Angeles: ONLY Logan
- San Diego: ONLY Logan
- NYC: Logan best, MHT acceptable (JetBlue 2025)
- Washington DC: Logan best, MHT acceptable
- Chicago: Logan best, MHT acceptable
- Florida: All airports serve well

### Medium-Term Viability (5-15 years)

**Manchester-Boston Regional (MHT):**
- **Best positioned** of regional alternatives
- Growing service, financial viability improving
- CRITICAL GAP: Capitol Corridor rail project stalled, unlikely in 5-15 year timeframe
- Without rail: 1.5-2 hour transit time or 65+ min drive from Kendall
- With rail (if built): Could be competitive for East Coast/Florida travel
- Still missing West Coast service
- **Realistic role**: 10-20% of Kendall travel (East Coast business, Florida leisure)

**Providence/T.F. Green (PVD):**
- Amtrak planning phase shows promise
- If T.F. Green gets direct Amtrak: ~45-50 min to Kendall (competitive!)
- **CRITICAL GAP**: Only planning funded, electrification expensive, no construction timeline
- Current weekend access very poor (no MBTA service)
- Service level adequate but not comprehensive
- **Realistic role**: 5-10% of Kendall travel IF Amtrak stop built; <5% otherwise

**Worcester Regional (ORH):**
- Closest geographically
- CRITICAL GAPS: 
  - Extremely limited service (204K passengers)
  - Airlines unwilling to add routes due to Logan proximity
  - 3 miles from rail station with only bus connection
- Grand Junction could help but ORH service is the bottleneck
- **Realistic role**: <5% of Kendall travel (mostly Florida leisure)

**Hanscom Field (BED):**
- Political environment makes expansion impossible
- Strong opposition from environmental and historical groups
- 60-seat aircraft limit constrains service
- No rail connection
- **Realistic role**: 0% (not viable for commercial service expansion)

**Regional Coordination:**
- NY-NJ Port Authority model theoretically appealing
- Zero political momentum
- Not realistic in 5-15 year timeframe
- **Realistic outcome**: Continued independent operation

### Cost-Benefit Assessment

**Rail Investment to Enable Regional Airports:**
- Grand Junction: $300-400M (primarily benefits Logan access if built)
- Capitol Corridor: $159-200M (stalled, interstate complexity)
- T.F. Green Amtrak: $100M+ (planning only)
- **Total: ~$600-700M for incomplete solution**

**Service Gap Problem:**
- Even with rail improvements, West Coast routes unavailable
- 40-50% of Kendall travel needs unmet by regional airports
- No indication airlines will add SF/Seattle/LA service to regional airports

**Alternative: Logan Access Improvements:**
- Grand Junction ($300-400M): Benefits Kendall access to ALL destinations via Logan
- Serves 100% of travel needs, not just 50%
- Multi-purpose benefit (not just airport access)

### Pragmatic Medium-Term Outlook

**What WILL Happen (High Probability):**

1. **Manchester (MHT) incremental growth**:
   - JetBlue adds NYC service (2025) ✓
   - Additional East Coast routes via airline incentive programs
   - Passenger growth to 1.5-1.8M by 2030s
   - Remains primarily leisure + East Coast business travel airport

2. **Capitol Corridor remains stalled**:
   - Conceptual studies continue
   - No funding commitment
   - Interstate political challenges unresolved

3. **Worcester (ORH) modest service**:
   - Florida routes continue
   - Philadelphia connection
   - Struggles to attract additional carriers
   - Remains small commercial airport (<300K passengers)

4. **T.F. Green Amtrak planning continues**:
   - Planning phase funded
   - Construction unfunded
   - Timeline uncertain (likely beyond 15 years)

5. **Logan remains dominant**:
   - 44M+ passengers maintained or grown
   - Only airport with comprehensive West Coast service
   - Only airport with international service
   - Continues to serve 70%+ of New England air travel

**What MIGHT Happen (Medium Probability):**

1. **Grand Junction Line built**:
   - $300-400M investment
   - Improves Kendall access to Worcester Line
   - Enables future western airport location
   - Primary benefit: Better Logan access, not regional airport access

2. **Corporate/KSA shuttle to MHT**:
   - $1-2M annual investment
   - Improves access for East Coast/Florida routes
   - Captures 10-15% of Kendall travel

3. **Airline adds one West Coast route to MHT**:
   - Possibly seasonal SFO or Seattle
   - Driven by market demand, not rail investment
   - Would be game-changing for tech travelers IF sustainable

**What WON'T Happen (Low Probability):**

1. **Regional Airport Authority**: No political momentum
2. **Capitol Corridor rail**: Stalled too long, no funding path
3. **Hanscom commercial expansion**: Political opposition insurmountable
4. **Comprehensive West Coast service from regional airports**: Market too small
5. **T.F. Green Amtrak station**: Possible but beyond 5-15 year timeframe

### Recommendations for Kendall Square

**Short-Term Actions (0-5 years):**

1. **Partner with MHT on shuttle service**:
   - Negotiate with KSA member companies for shared funding
   - Target routes: NYC, DC, Florida
   - Realistic capture: 10-15% of appropriate travel

2. **Educate Kendall travelers on optimal airport choice**:
   - Marketing campaign: "Right airport for the right trip"
   - MHT for NYC, DC, Florida
   - Logan for SF, Seattle, LA, San Diego, international

3. **Advocate for Grand Junction Line**:
   - Benefits Kendall regardless of airport used
   - Improves access to Logan (primary benefit)
   - Enables future western airport location
   - Multi-purpose transportation benefit

**Medium-Term Strategy (5-15 years):**

1. **Monitor T.F. Green Amtrak progress**:
   - If built, could be competitive with Logan access time
   - Contingent on funding and construction timeline
   - Don't plan around it, but be ready to capitalize

2. **Consider subsidizing one critical route**:
   - MHT-SFO or MHT-Seattle
   - 2-3 year minimum revenue guarantee
   - Cost: $5-10M total
   - High impact IF sustainable
   - Risk: Airline discontinues after subsidy

3. **Participate in regional transportation planning**:
   - Support North-South Rail Link (benefits all destinations)
   - Support Grand Junction (direct Kendall benefit)
   - Oppose Red-Blue Connector prioritization (minimal Kendall benefit vs. cost)

**Long-Term Vision (15+ years):**

1. **Support planning for western Massachusetts airport**:
   - Grand Junction Line enables Allston/Brighton location
   - Could be designed for Kendall access from inception
   - More realistic than fixing Logan location problem

2. **Advocate for regional coordination (without formal authority)**:
   - Informal cooperation among MA, NH, RI airports
   - Avoid duplication of service
   - Coordinate on route development
   - Less politically complex than formal authority

### Key Insights

1. **Geography matters more than rail**: No amount of rail investment makes Worcester/Manchester/Providence competitive with Logan for West Coast travel when there's no air service.

2. **Service determines utility**: Kendall's tech/biotech focus requires West Coast access. Regional airports fundamentally cannot serve this need at current scale.

3. **Incremental growth likely**: MHT will grow to 1.5-1.8M passengers through airline incentives, not major rail projects.

4. **Grand Junction most valuable**: $300-400M investment helps Logan access (100% of destinations) more than enabling regional airports (50% of destinations).

5. **Best realistic outcome**: Regional airports capture 15-25% of Kendall travel (East Coast business + Florida leisure) while Logan remains dominant for tech industry (West Coast + international).

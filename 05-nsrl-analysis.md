# North-South Rail Link (NSRL) Analysis

**Timeline**: Long-term (15-25 years if pursued)
**Cost**: $8-21 billion (estimates vary widely)
**Status**: Not actively pursued; advocacy ongoing

---

## Overview

The North-South Rail Link is a proposed ~1.5 mile rail tunnel connecting North Station and South Station in downtown Boston. It would unify the currently separate northern and southern commuter rail networks and enable through-running Amtrak service.

---

## Current Status (December 2024)

### NOT ACTIVELY PURSUED
- No active development or planning
- MassDOT (March 2024): "currently there is no new study planned"
- Healey administration pursuing South Station expansion instead
- Last official study: MassDOT Feasibility Reassessment (January 2019)

### Recent Developments
- Rep. Moulton commissioned Harvard study (June 2024): $8B cost, $30B benefits
- Former Gov. Dukakis opposes South Station expansion as "wrong-headed waste of money"
- Rep. Lynch: "quite difficult to obtain significant federal funding"

## Cost Estimates

| Study | Year | Estimate | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Harvard Kennedy School | 2017 | $3.8-5.9B | Independent analysis |
| MassDOT Feasibility | 2018 | $12.3-21.5B | Official state study |
| Moulton-commissioned | 2024 | $7.9-8B | Updated estimate |

### Why the Huge Range?
- Tunnel configurations (2 vs 4 tracks)
- Station depths and locations (115-195 feet below surface)
- Contingency factors
- Rolling stock and electrification costs

---

## Projected Benefits (2024 Harvard Study)

| Benefit | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Economic benefits | $28-31 billion over 20 years |
| Benefit-cost ratio | 3.6-3.9 to 1 |
| New annual rides | 86 million (quadrupling commuter rail) |
| Additional fare revenue | $7 billion over 20 years |
| New housing enabled | 150,000+ units |
| Transit-oriented development | $5.8-8.7 billion |

**Comparison**: South Station expansion alone would deliver only $3 billion in net benefits.

## Impact on Existing Airport (Logan)

### How NSRL Improves Logan Access
With NSRL, **through-running trains** could serve Logan via:
1. Red-Blue Connector (transfer at Charles/MGH to Blue Line)
2. South Station-Logan tunnel spur (if built as Phase 2)

### Specific Improvements
| Route | Current | With NSRL |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Worcester → Logan | 60+ min (transfer at SS + Silver Line) | 40-45 min (through-run + Blue/tunnel) |
| Lowell → Logan | 70+ min (North Station + Blue) | 50-55 min (through-run + Blue) |
| Providence → Logan | 50+ min (transfer at SS + Silver Line) | 35-40 min (through-run + tunnel) |

### Without Logan Tunnel Spur
NSRL alone (without South Station-Logan tunnel) provides modest improvement:
- Better frequency (trains from both networks)
- Easier transfers at unified downtown station
- But still requires Blue Line or Silver Line for final leg

---

## Impact on New Airport

### If Western Airport Built (Devens area, 40 miles)
With NSRL + electrification:
| Origin | Travel Time |
|--------|-------------|
| Downtown Boston | 35-40 min |
| Cambridge/Kendall | 30-35 min (via Grand Junction preferred) |
| South Boston | 40-45 min |
| Back Bay | 35-40 min |

### NSRL + New Airport = True Regional System
- Through-running enables "get on train anywhere, go to airport"
- Mimics Schiphol model (8 trains/hour from all directions)
- Makes 40-mile distance acceptable

---

## Engineering Challenges

### Tunnel Depth
- Station depths: 115-195 feet below surface (deeper than Porter Square at 105 ft)
- Must clear existing infrastructure (subways, Big Dig tunnels)
- Descent: 3% grade starting ~4,700 feet from stations

### Five Portals Required
1. Two at North Point (Fitchburg Line and northern lines)
2. One at Back Bay (Worcester and Amtrak)
3. Two at South Bay (Old Colony and Dorchester Branch)

### Electrification Requirement
- Tunnels cannot handle diesel locomotives
- Requires dual-mode locomotives OR full electrification
- Fairmount Line pilot (2028) is first step

---

## Political Landscape

### Supporters
**Federal**: Rep. Seth Moulton (primary champion), Sen. Markey, Reps. Clark, McGovern
**State**: 175 state legislators signed letter of support; Former Govs. Dukakis, Weld
**Municipal**: Mayor Wu; 25+ mayors (Cambridge, Worcester, Springfield, Salem, Somerville, etc.)
**Advocacy**: TransitMatters, Sierra Club MA, Citizens for NSRL, A Better City

### Opposition/Skeptics
- Healey administration (prioritizing other projects)
- Rep. William Straus (Transportation Committee)
- Those concerned about MBTA's $24.5 billion maintenance backlog

---

## Arguments For and Against

### FOR
1. Regional connectivity: Direct Amtrak NYC-Portland, unified commuter rail
2. Climate benefits: 55,000+ daily auto trips diverted to transit
3. Economic development: $30B benefits, 150K housing units
4. Capacity: 25% increase in commuter rail seats downtown
5. Modern tunneling: TBM technology proven, minimal surface disruption

### AGAINST
1. Cost: $8-21 billion depending on estimate
2. Construction disruption: 2+ years of service impacts
3. Depth concerns: 115-195 feet deep, evacuation challenges
4. Single point of failure: All lines would depend on tunnel
5. Competing priorities: MBTA has $24.5B maintenance backlog

---

## Relationship to Other Projects

### NSRL + Grand Junction
- Grand Junction provides direct Kendall service that NSRL doesn't
- Grand Junction costs 1/20th of NSRL
- For Kendall specifically, Grand Junction may be better investment

### NSRL + Red-Blue Connector
- Red-Blue Connector enables Red Line → Blue Line → Logan
- Works with or without NSRL
- Should be built regardless of NSRL decision

### NSRL + Regional Rail Electrification
- NSRL requires electrification to work
- Electrification benefits exist with or without NSRL (faster, cleaner, more reliable)
- Fairmount pilot (2028) is foundation for both

---

## Recommendation for KSA

### Position
- **Support NSRL in principle** as part of long-term regional vision
- **Don't wait for NSRL** - focus on achievable projects:
  1. Short-term: Shuttle (0-2 years)
  2. Medium-term: Red-Blue Connector (2031), Grand Junction (2030s)
  3. Long-term: NSRL (if political will emerges)

### Key Message
> "NSRL would transform regional connectivity, but Kendall Square can't wait 20 years. Grand Junction provides most of the same benefits for 1/20th the cost and can be built in the 2030s."

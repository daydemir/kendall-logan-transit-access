# New Massachusetts Regional Airport: 50-Year Vision

**Timeline**: Long-term (50+ years for full realization)
**Philosophy**: Solve the problem permanently, not with expensive band-aids
**Key Insight**: Logan is in the wrong location - that's an error of the past we can fix

---

## The Core Problem

Logan Airport is:
- 3 miles from downtown (closer than any US airport except San Diego)
- Surrounded by water (cannot expand)
- In an Environmental Justice community (East Boston: 74% minority, 4x asthma rates)
- At capacity: 44M passengers (170% of design capacity)
- Projected to hit hard capacity (~55-60M) by 2032

**The problem isn't access - it's that the airport is in the wrong location.**

## The Schiphol Model

### Netherlands Comparison
| Metric | Netherlands | Massachusetts |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Land area | 41,543 km² | 20,306 km² |
| Population | 17.8 million | 6.5 million |
| Airports | 1 major (Schiphol) | 1 major (Logan) |

**If the Dutch can serve 17.8M people with one rail-connected airport, Massachusetts can serve 6.5M.**

### What Makes Schiphol Work
| Feature | Schiphol | Implication for MA |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Distance from Amsterdam | 9 miles | 25-40 miles is acceptable with fast rail |
| Train time | 14-17 min | 25-40 min achievable with electrification |
| Train frequency | 8 trains/hour | Need 4+ trains/hour minimum |
| Transit mode share | 47% | 30-40% achievable |
| 24-hour service | Yes | Would need to add |

---

## Location Options

### The Reality: No Close-In Sites Available
There is no location 9 miles from Boston with:
- 1,000+ acres available
- Existing or buildable rail connection
- Political viability

All land within 15-20 miles is developed, protected, or owned by wealthy communities that will fight.

### Tier 1: Most Realistic (25-40 miles)

**Option A: Fort Devens**
| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Distance | 40 miles |
| Travel time (electrified) | 35-40 min |
| Land | 4,400 acres (largest available) |
| Rail | Fitchburg Line serves Ayer/Shirley stations |
| Ownership | State-owned (MassDevelopment) |
| Pros | Largest land, state ownership, direct rail, low cost, serves Central MA |
| Cons | 35-40 min travel time, Fitchburg Line needs major upgrades |

**Option B: Worcester Regional + Rail Connection**
| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Distance | 45 miles |
| Travel time (electrified) | 40-45 min |
| Land | Already an airport |
| Rail | Need 3-5 mile spur from Union Station |
| Passengers | 229K currently (tiny vs Logan's 44M) |
| Pros | Already operational, Massport-owned |
| Cons | 40-45 min travel, limited current service, no rail to airport |

### Tier 2: Supplementary (Closer but Limited)

**Beverly Regional Airport**
| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Distance | 14 miles |
| Travel time (electrified) | 20-25 min |
| Rail | 3 miles from Beverly Station (Newburyport/Rockport Line) |
| Growth | #9 → #2 GA airport in MA in 3 years |
| Limitation | Serves North Shore only; cannot replace Logan |
| Role | Secondary for regional/domestic flights |

### Tier 3: Not Viable

**Hanscom Field**
- 14 miles, 1,125 acres, 7,011 ft runway
- **Politically impossible**: 4 wealthy towns (Bedford, Lexington, Lincoln, Concord) with decades of organized opposition
- 2024: State rejected even modest private jet hangar expansion
- Emerson and Thoreau descendants leading petition against expansion

## What's Required for a New Airport

### Infrastructure Investments
| Component | Estimated Cost |
|-----------|----------------|
| Airport construction | $10-15 billion |
| Rail connection (if new) | $1-5 billion |
| NSRL (enables through-running) | $8-21 billion |
| Electrification | $5-10 billion system-wide |
| **Total** | **$25-50 billion** |

### Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Site selection | 2-5 years | Political process |
| Environmental review | 3-5 years | NEPA/MEPA |
| Design | 2-4 years | Overlaps with review |
| Construction | 5-8 years | New airport typically 5-7 years |
| **Total** | **12-22 years** | With opposition: 25-35 years |

## Marketing: "Massachusetts Airport" Not "Boston Airport"

### The Framing
Following Schiphol model (not "Amsterdam Airport" - positioned as Dutch national airport):
- **"Massachusetts Gateway Airport"**
- **"New England Regional Airport"**
- Serves Worcester, Springfield, AND Boston equally
- Access from BOTH sides (west and east via NSRL)

### Who Benefits from Western Location
| Region | Population | Current Access | Improvement |
|--------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Worcester metro | 867,000 | 45+ min to Logan | Closer, direct rail |
| Springfield metro | 685,000 | 90+ min to Logan | MUCH closer |
| I-495 corridor | 289,000 workers | Variable | Rail-connected option |
| Central MA | 862,000 | Poor access | Major improvement |
| Pioneer Valley | 600,000+ | Uses Hartford/Bradley | New option |

**Total underserved population: ~2.5 million**

## Environmental Justice Framing

### Logan's Burden on East Boston
| Impact | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Population | 74% minority, 53% Latino/Hispanic |
| Income | 44% of state median |
| Pollution | 35,000+ lbs daily from airport |
| Health | Children 4x more likely to have asthma |
| Space | Airport took 70 acres including Wood Island Park (1967) |

### How New Airport Provides Remedy
1. **Flights over less dense areas** - Devens is rural/suburban
2. **Rail access = less car traffic** - Reduces tunnel traffic through East Boston
3. **Logan demand reduction** - Fewer flights = less pollution
4. **East Boston gets relief** after decades of burden

### Coalition Building
| Stakeholder | Frame |
|-------------|-------|
| East Boston (GreenRoots, AIR Inc.) | EJ remedy, pollution reduction |
| Kendall Square | Better access, one-seat ride |
| Central/Western MA | Finally have an airport |
| Climate advocates | Mode shift, reduced driving |
| Massport | Long-term capacity solution |

## The 50-Year Vision

### Phase 1 (2025-2035): Foundation
- Build Red-Blue Connector
- Advance Grand Junction
- Electrify commuter rail (Fairmount pilot 2028)
- Study NSRL seriously

### Phase 2 (2035-2050): NSRL Era
- Build NSRL if politically viable
- Enables through-running
- Begin new airport site selection and environmental review

### Phase 3 (2050-2075): New Airport
- Construct new airport (Devens or similar)
- Full rail integration with NSRL
- One-seat ride from Kendall in 35-45 min
- Logan potentially repurposed (corporate, international hub, or redeveloped)

---

## Alternative: Regional Airport Coordination

### The NY-NJ Port Authority Model
Instead of building new, coordinate existing airports:
- **Logan** (central, 44M passengers)
- **Manchester-Boston** (north, 1.27M passengers, growing)
- **T.F. Green** (south, Rhode Island)
- **Worcester** (west, 229K passengers)
- **Bradley** (Hartford, CT)

### Concept
- Shared governance (representatives from participating states)
- Integrated ticketing
- Rail connections to all
- Distribute load, reduce Logan pressure

### Current Status
- Advocacy exists ([Boston Globe op-ed August 2025](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/25/opinion/regional-airport-system/))
- No active legislation
- Would require interstate compact (complex)

---

## Recommendation

### For Policy Memo
1. **Acknowledge Logan's fundamental problem** - wrong location, not fixable with transit
2. **Frame new airport as 50-year vision** - not immediate solution
3. **Advocate for NSRL as foundation** - enables any future airport to work
4. **Support regional coordination** - pragmatic medium-term step
5. **Emphasize EJ remedy** - new airport relieves East Boston burden

### Key Message
> "Boston airport should be an airport for all of Massachusetts. A rail-connected regional airport would serve 2.5 million currently underserved residents while providing environmental justice relief for East Boston. This is a 50-year vision that requires starting now."

# New Massachusetts Regional Airport: 50-Year Vision

**Timeline**: Long-term (50+ years for full realization)
**Philosophy**: Solve the problem permanently, not with expensive band-aids
**Key Insight**: Logan is in the wrong location - that's an error of the past we can fix

---

## The Core Problem

Logan Airport is:
- 3 miles from downtown (closer than any US airport except San Diego)
- Surrounded by water (cannot expand)
- In an Environmental Justice community (East Boston: 74% minority, 4x asthma rates)
- At capacity: 44M passengers (170% of design capacity)
- Projected to hit hard capacity (~55-60M) by 2032

**The problem isn't access - it's that the airport is in the wrong location.**

---

## The Schiphol Model

### Netherlands Comparison
| Metric | Netherlands | Massachusetts |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Land area | 41,543 km² | 20,306 km² |
| Population | 17.8 million | 6.5 million |
| Airports | 1 major (Schiphol) | 1 major (Logan) |

**If the Dutch can serve 17.8M people with one rail-connected airport, Massachusetts can serve 6.5M.**

### What Makes Schiphol Work
| Feature | Schiphol | Implication for MA |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Distance from Amsterdam | 9 miles | 25-40 miles is acceptable with fast rail |
| Train time | 14-17 min | 25-40 min achievable with electrification |
| Train frequency | 8 trains/hour | Need 4+ trains/hour minimum |
| Transit mode share | 47% | 30-40% achievable |
| 24-hour service | Yes | Would need to add |

## Comprehensive Site Analysis: Can We Get Closer Than Devens?

### The Core Question
If we're willing to build NEW rail lines (not just use existing ones), can we find a viable airport site closer than Fort Devens (40 miles)?

### The Answer: NO - The Constraint is LAND, Not Rail

**Key Finding from Multi-Angle Research:**
Even if we could build rail to ANY location, there simply isn't 1,000+ acres available within 25 miles of Boston that could be used for an airport. The constraint is land availability, not rail infrastructure.

| Distance from Boston | Sites Identified | Status |
|---------------------|------------------|--------|
| 0-15 miles | South Weymouth NAS (1,400 acres) | **Committed to 6,000 housing units** (2025 legislation) |
| 15-20 miles | Hanscom Field (1,125 acres) | **Politically impossible** (wealthy opposition + military) |
| 20-30 miles | No 1,000+ acre parcels | All developed, protected, or fragmented |
| 30-40 miles | Fort Devens (4,400 acres) | **Only viable option** |

### Why No Closer Sites Exist

1. **Dense Development**: Boston metro is one of the most densely developed in the US
2. **Article 97 Protection**: Large state forests (Myles Standish: 12,400 acres) are constitutionally protected - requires 2/3 legislative vote to convert
3. **Wealthy Suburbs**: Communities within 25 miles are politically powerful and oppose any major development
4. **Historical Pattern**: Even Logan's expansion (1940s-50s) destroyed Wood Island Park, causing lasting resentment
5. **Environmental Era**: Modern regulations make large-scale land conversion nearly impossible

## Top 5 Airport Location Candidates (Ranked)

### International Benchmarks for Travel Time

Before evaluating sites, key international comparisons:

| Airport | Distance | Travel Time | Rail Type |
|---------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Oslo Gardermoen | 50 km (31 mi) | **19 min** | Dedicated high-speed (new-build) |
| Stockholm Arlanda | 42 km (26 mi) | **20 min** | Dedicated new-build, 200 km/h |
| Hong Kong | 35 km (22 mi) | **24 min** | Dedicated new-build |
| Munich | 30 km (19 mi) | **36-40 min** | S-Bahn extension |
| Narita (Tokyo) | 60 km (37 mi) | **53 min** | Regional express |

**Maximum Practical Distance**: Research suggests 30-50 km (18-31 miles) is viable with travel time under 30 min and frequency of 10-15 min.

---

### #1: Fort Devens (RECOMMENDED)

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Distance** | 40 miles (64 km) from North Station |
| **Land** | 4,400 acres developable + 5,220 acres total (largest available) |
| **Ownership** | State-owned (MassDevelopment) |
| **Existing Infrastructure** | Moore Army Airfield still exists with intact runways (1940-1995) |
| **Rail** | Fitchburg Line (Ayer station) - already serves site |

**Fitchburg Line Route Analysis (Actual Constraints)**

The Fitchburg Line has tight curves that physically limit speed:
- Urban section (North Stn→Waltham): 60-70 mph max due to curves
- Single-track rock cut through Waltham: 50 mph
- Best rural segments (Concord→Ayer): 100-110 mph possible with upgrades
- **True high-speed (125+ mph) NOT possible** without $3-5B complete realignment

**Travel Times (Realistic Based on Route Geometry)**
| Scenario | North Station | South Station (via NSRL) | Investment |
|----------|---------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Current diesel | **88 min** | N/A | - |
| Electrified EMU only | **62-66 min** | **70-74 min** | ~$500M |
| + Grade crossing elimination | **55-60 min** | **63-68 min** | +$200M |
| + Track upgrades (Class 5/6) | **48-53 min** | **56-61 min** | +$400M |

**Travel Times to Worcester/Springfield (New Connections Required)**
| Destination | Current | With New Spur/Line |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Worcester | No direct service | **40-50 min** (via new connection) |
| Springfield | No direct service | **70-90 min** (via new line) |

**Why #1:**
- Only site with 4,000+ acres in state ownership
- Existing aviation infrastructure
- Existing rail connection (needs electrification, not new construction)
- Located to serve both Boston AND Central/Western MA
- **48-53 min travel time** competitive with international benchmarks (Munich: 36-40 min at 30km)

**Alternative Routes Considered (None Faster)**
| Route | Distance | Status | vs. Fitchburg |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Fitchburg Line (baseline) | 36 mi | Active | Best option |
| Lowell Line + Stony Brook | 37 mi | Freight-only connection | Slower (transfer + single track) |
| Worcester + W&N Railroad | 70 mi | Freight-only | Much slower (double distance) |
| Route 2 corridor | - | IS the Fitchburg Line | Same |
| Central Mass Railroad | - | Abandoned since 1970s | Not viable |

The Fitchburg Line's 36-mile route is remarkably direct (straight-line distance is 30 miles). The 2024 Northern Tier Passenger Rail Study ($1.5-3B) confirms this is the optimal corridor.

---

### #2: South Weymouth NAS (IF Housing Reversed)

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Distance** | 15 miles (24 km) from South Station |
| **Land** | 1,400 acres total (885 acres preserved as open space in current plan) |
| **Ownership** | Mixed - New England Development/Brookfield + state |
| **Rail** | Kingston Line - South Weymouth station directly adjacent |
| **Status** | **BLOCKED**: $32.4M state funding + 2025 legislation committed to housing |

**Travel Times (Electrified Rail)**
| Destination | Electrified Express | High-Speed (if new) |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| South Station | **18-22 min** | **12-15 min** |
| North Station (via NSRL) | **28-32 min** | **22-25 min** |
| Worcester | **45-50 min** (new connection) | **30-35 min** |
| Springfield | **85-95 min** | **55-60 min** |

**Why #2:**
- Best location by distance (15 miles)
- Existing aviation history (NAS 1942-1997)
- Direct rail access already exists
- **BUT: Politically impossible** - 6,000 housing units already committed

---

### #3: Plymouth County Cranberry Assembly

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Distance** | 30 miles (48 km) from South Station |
| **Land** | Requires assembling 800-1,000 acres from multiple parcels |
| **Target Area** | Hanson/Carver/Kingston - declining cranberry bogs |
| **Rail** | Kingston Line - Kingston station 3-5 miles from potential sites |
| **Opportunity** | Industry declining = willing sellers; 468-acre farm currently for sale |

**Travel Times (Electrified Rail)**
| Destination | Electrified Express | With New Station |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| South Station | **28-32 min** | **25-28 min** |
| North Station (via NSRL) | **38-42 min** | **35-38 min** |
| Worcester | **50-55 min** | **45-50 min** |
| Springfield | **90-100 min** | **70-80 min** |

**Why #3:**
- Closer than Devens (30 vs 40 miles)
- Flat terrain (former bogs = runway-ready)
- Economic opportunity for declining cranberry region
- **BUT: Requires land assembly from multiple owners**

---

### #4: Worcester Regional Airport (Expansion)

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Distance** | 45 miles (72 km) from South Station |
| **Land** | Already an airport (can expand) |
| **Ownership** | Massport-owned |
| **Rail** | Worcester Line to Union Station; need 3-5 mile spur to airport |
| **Current Passengers** | 229,000/year (tiny vs Logan's 44M) |

**Travel Times (Electrified Rail)**
| Destination | Electrified Express | High-Speed (new) |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| South Station | **40-45 min** | **28-32 min** |
| North Station (via NSRL) | **50-55 min** | **38-42 min** |
| Worcester (Union Stn) | **8-10 min** (spur) | **5-8 min** |
| Springfield | **45-55 min** | **25-30 min** |

**Why #4:**
- Already operational airport
- Massport ownership simplifies governance
- Best option for Western MA access
- **BUT: Farthest from Boston; limited land for major expansion**

---

### #5: Middleborough/Lakeville Corridor

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Distance** | 40 miles (64 km) from South Station |
| **Land** | Potential large parcels along new rail line |
| **Rail** | New Fall River/New Bedford Line opened 2025 |
| **Advantage** | Serves dual market: Boston + Providence (30 miles) |

**Travel Times (Electrified Rail)**
| Destination | Electrified Express |
|-------------|---------------------|
| South Station | **35-40 min** |
| North Station (via NSRL) | **45-50 min** |
| Worcester | **55-65 min** |
| Springfield | **95-110 min** |
| Providence | **25-30 min** |

**Why #5:**
- New rail service (2025) creates opportunity
- Could serve Providence market (underserved by TF Green)
- Lower income area = potentially less NIMBY opposition
- **BUT: Land availability unconfirmed; as far as Devens without the state ownership advantage**

## Rail Construction Cost Analysis

### If We Build New Rail Lines

| Distance | At-Grade Suburban | Mixed (some elevated) | With Tunneling |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| 10 miles | $0.5-1.5B | $1.5-3B | $5-20B |
| 15 miles | $0.8-2.3B | $2.5-5B | $8-30B |
| 20 miles | $1-3B | $5-10B | $10-40B |

**Recent Benchmarks:**
- Denver A-Line (airport rail, 23.6 mi): ~$85M/mile
- MBTA South Coast Rail (50 mi, existing ROW): ~$21M/mile
- BART San Jose Extension (6 mi, underground): **$2,125M/mile**

**Key Insight**: Building new rail to a closer site would cost $2-10B, but the land still doesn't exist. Using existing rail to Devens requires only electrification (~$200-400M for Fitchburg Line).

---

## Comparative Summary: All 5 Sites

| Rank | Site | Distance | Rail Time (Best Case) | Land | Viability |
|------|------|----------|----------------------|------|-----------|
| **1** | Fort Devens | 40 mi | **48-53 min** (N. Stn) | 4,400 acres | **HIGH** - State-owned, existing rail |
| **2** | S. Weymouth NAS | 15 mi | 18-22 min (S. Stn) | 1,400 acres | **NONE** - Committed to housing |
| **3** | Plymouth Cranberry | 30 mi | 28-32 min (S. Stn) | ~800 acres | **MEDIUM** - Requires assembly |
| **4** | Worcester Regional | 45 mi | 40-45 min (S. Stn) | Existing | **MEDIUM** - Already airport |
| **5** | Middleborough | 40 mi | 35-40 min (S. Stn) | Unknown | **LOW** - Land unconfirmed |

*Note: Devens time reflects realistic Fitchburg Line route analysis. True high-speed (125 mph) not achievable without $3-5B rebuild.*

---

## Location Options

### The Reality: No Close-In Sites Available
There is no location within 25 miles of Boston with:
- 1,000+ acres available
- Existing or buildable rail connection
- Political viability

**Even building new rail lines doesn't solve this** - the constraint is land, not infrastructure.

### Tier 1: Most Realistic (35-45 miles)

**Option A: Fort Devens (RECOMMENDED)**
| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Distance | 40 miles |
| Travel time (current) | 88 min |
| Travel time (electrified) | 62-66 min (EMU only) → **48-53 min** (full upgrade) |
| Land | 4,400 acres (largest available) |
| Rail | Fitchburg Line - existing, needs electrification + track upgrades |
| Ownership | State-owned (MassDevelopment) |
| Existing Infrastructure | Moore Army Airfield with intact runways |
| Pros | Largest land, state ownership, existing rail, existing aviation infrastructure |
| Cons | Fitchburg Line curves limit speed; 125 mph not achievable without rebuild |

**Option B: Worcester Regional + Rail Connection**
| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Distance | 45 miles |
| Travel time (electrified) | 40-45 min |
| Land | Already an airport |
| Rail | Need 3-5 mile spur from Union Station |
| Passengers | 229K currently (tiny vs Logan's 44M) |
| Pros | Already operational, Massport-owned, best for Western MA |
| Cons | 40-45 min travel, limited land for expansion |

### Tier 2: Theoretically Closer but Blocked

**South Weymouth NAS (15 miles)**
- 1,400 acres, existing aviation infrastructure
- **Status: UNAVAILABLE** - 2025 legislation committed site to 6,000 housing units + $32.4M state investment
- Would require legislative reversal (extremely unlikely)

**Plymouth County Cranberry Assembly (~30 miles)**
- Could potentially assemble 800-1,000 acres from declining bogs
- Near Kingston Line rail
- Requires multi-parcel land assembly (complex, uncertain)

### Tier 3: Not Viable

**Hanscom Field (18 miles)**
- 1,125 acres, 11,597 ft runway (longest in New England)
- **Politically impossible**: 4 wealthy towns (Bedford, Lexington, Lincoln, Concord) with decades of organized opposition
- 2024: State rejected even modest 17-hangar expansion
- Active military installation (essential DoD facility)

---

## What's Required for a New Airport

### Infrastructure Investments
| Component | Estimated Cost |
|-----------|----------------|
| Airport construction | $10-15 billion |
| Rail connection (if new) | $1-5 billion |
| NSRL (enables through-running) | $8-21 billion |
| Electrification | $5-10 billion system-wide |
| **Total** | **$25-50 billion** |

### Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Site selection | 2-5 years | Political process |
| Environmental review | 3-5 years | NEPA/MEPA |
| Design | 2-4 years | Overlaps with review |
| Construction | 5-8 years | New airport typically 5-7 years |
| **Total** | **12-22 years** | With opposition: 25-35 years |

---

## Marketing: "Massachusetts Airport" Not "Boston Airport"

### The Framing
Following Schiphol model (not "Amsterdam Airport" - positioned as Dutch national airport):
- **"Massachusetts Gateway Airport"**
- **"New England Regional Airport"**
- Serves Worcester, Springfield, AND Boston equally
- Access from BOTH sides (west and east via NSRL)

### Who Benefits from Western Location
| Region | Population | Current Access | Improvement |
|--------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| Worcester metro | 867,000 | 45+ min to Logan | Closer, direct rail |
| Springfield metro | 685,000 | 90+ min to Logan | MUCH closer |
| I-495 corridor | 289,000 workers | Variable | Rail-connected option |
| Central MA | 862,000 | Poor access | Major improvement |
| Pioneer Valley | 600,000+ | Uses Hartford/Bradley | New option |

**Total underserved population: ~2.5 million**

---

## Environmental Justice Framing

### Logan's Burden on East Boston
| Impact | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Population | 74% minority, 53% Latino/Hispanic |
| Income | 44% of state median |
| Pollution | 35,000+ lbs daily from airport |
| Health | Children 4x more likely to have asthma |
| Space | Airport took 70 acres including Wood Island Park (1967) |

### How New Airport Provides Remedy
1. **Flights over less dense areas** - Devens is rural/suburban
2. **Rail access = less car traffic** - Reduces tunnel traffic through East Boston
3. **Logan demand reduction** - Fewer flights = less pollution
4. **East Boston gets relief** after decades of burden

### Coalition Building
| Stakeholder | Frame |
|-------------|-------|
| East Boston (GreenRoots, AIR Inc.) | EJ remedy, pollution reduction |
| Kendall Square | Better access, one-seat ride |
| Central/Western MA | Finally have an airport |
| Climate advocates | Mode shift, reduced driving |
| Massport | Long-term capacity solution |

---

## The 50-Year Vision

### Phase 1 (2025-2035): Foundation
- Build Red-Blue Connector
- Advance Grand Junction
- Electrify commuter rail (Fairmount pilot 2028)
- Study NSRL seriously

### Phase 2 (2035-2050): NSRL Era
- Build NSRL if politically viable
- Enables through-running
- Begin new airport site selection and environmental review

### Phase 3 (2050-2075): New Airport
- Construct new airport (Devens or similar)
- Full rail integration with NSRL
- One-seat ride from Kendall in 35-45 min
- Logan potentially repurposed (corporate, international hub, or redeveloped)

---

## Alternative: Regional Airport Coordination

### The NY-NJ Port Authority Model
Instead of building new, coordinate existing airports:
- **Logan** (central, 44M passengers)
- **Manchester-Boston** (north, 1.27M passengers, growing)
- **T.F. Green** (south, Rhode Island)
- **Worcester** (west, 229K passengers)
- **Bradley** (Hartford, CT)

### Concept
- Shared governance (representatives from participating states)
- Integrated ticketing
- Rail connections to all
- Distribute load, reduce Logan pressure

### Current Status
- Advocacy exists ([Boston Globe op-ed August 2025](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/25/opinion/regional-airport-system/))
- No active legislation
- Would require interstate compact (complex)

---

## Recommendation

### For Policy Memo
1. **Acknowledge Logan's fundamental problem** - wrong location, not fixable with transit
2. **Frame new airport as 50-year vision** - not immediate solution
3. **Advocate for NSRL as foundation** - enables any future airport to work
4. **Support regional coordination** - pragmatic medium-term step
5. **Emphasize EJ remedy** - new airport relieves East Boston burden

### Key Message
> "Boston airport should be an airport for all of Massachusetts. A rail-connected regional airport would serve 2.5 million currently underserved residents while providing environmental justice relief for East Boston. This is a 50-year vision that requires starting now."

# Assignment 3 Summary: Kendall Square to Logan Airport Transit Access

## Scenario
You're a consultant hired by the Kendall Square Association (KSA) to improve transit access between Kendall Square and Logan Airport.

## The Problem
Many Kendall workers (biotech, academia, etc.) choose cars/rideshare over transit to get to Logan due to poor connections. Current transit options:
- Red Line → Silver Line (SL1/SL3) → Logan
- Blue Line → Airport Station → Logan Terminal Shuttles

The Red and Blue Lines don't connect (gap between Charles/MGH and Bowdoin), making this cumbersome.

## Deliverables

### 3(A) - Policy Memo
A roadmap for KSA to take to Massport, Boston, MassDOT, and MBTA. Should cover:
- Specific policies/interventions you're proposing
- Efficacy, cost, potential funding sources
- Measures of success
- Mitigation of negative impacts
- Stakeholder identification (who's impacted, who needs to support it)
- How to generate political will and consensus
- Possibly pilot programs to gather data

No set length, but keep it clear and concise for busy non-expert readers.

### 3(B) - Op-Ed (~700-1,000 words)
For Commonwealth Beacon to "float a trial balloon" and test public reaction to your ideas.

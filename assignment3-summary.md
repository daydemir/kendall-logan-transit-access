# Assignment 3 Summary: Kendall Square to Logan Airport Transit Access

## Your Role
You are a consultant hired by the **Kendall Square Association (KSA)** to develop a plan for improving transit access to/from Logan Airport from Kendall Square.

---

## The Problem (from syllabus)

### Current Transit Options from Kendall to Logan
1. **Red Line to Silver Line to Logan Airport via the SL1 or SL3**
2. **Blue Line to Airport Station then onto Logan Terminal Shuttles**

### Key Infrastructure Gap
- **Logan Express does not currently serve Kendall Square**
- **The Red and Blue lines do not connect**, leaving a gap between Charles/MGH and Bowdoin stations

### The Behavioral Problem
> "Currently, many travelers working from academic, biotech or other businesses in the Kendall Square area feel compelled to use some form of vehicular mobility (personal vehicle or ride hailing) to access Logan Airport as they are unwilling to deal with the existing real or perceived deficiencies in transit access."

### The Impact
> "This places a significant traffic congestion and emissions burden on East Boston and the Logan Airport landside complex."

---

## Broader Context (from Assignments 1 & 2 sections)

### The Red-Blue Connector
- Transit advocates have persuaded MBTA to include the connection of the Red and Blue Lines as a project on its official construction plan
- The Blue Line offers a direct transit ride to Logan International Airport
- MBTA appears to favor the elimination of Bowdoin station as part of the overall plan to connect the Red and Blue Lines

### East Boston Context
- East Boston is an EJ (Environmental Justice) community with a significant underserved population
- A developer is constructing 10,000 units of housing at Suffolk Downs, served by 2 Blue Line stops
- Reference: Northeastern University's Dukakis Center report, "The Toll of Transportation"

### The Short-Term vs Long-Term Question (from Assignment 2)
> "What improvements in access are feasible to improve conditions TODAY, and are they consistent with the longer range desirable outcome?"

---

## Deliverables

### 3(A) - Policy Memo

**Purpose:** A roadmap with enough detail that it provides KSA with a strong, fact-and-data-based platform to advance their discussions with key public stakeholders: **Massport, Boston, MassDOT and the MBTA**.

**Must address:**
- Policies and/or interventions you would propose
- Efficacy
- Cost
- Potential funding sources
- Measures of success
- Mitigation of negative impacts
- Potential or likely impacts on a broad spectrum of residents and stakeholders
- Identify stakeholders who will be impacted by, and/or need to support your proposal
- How to generate political will and develop consensus or buy-in among stakeholders
- Perhaps ideas for pilots that can be implemented to gather data

**Audience:**
> "Remember that you are writing a plan that is meant to be read and understood by the Executive Director of KSA and her senior staff and Board, who are smart but very busy people and not transportation experts. Hence your memo should be clear, concise, engaging, and mindful of the audience. There are no extra points for logorrhea."

**Length:** No suggested length.

### 3(B) - Op-Ed (~700-1,000 words max)

**Purpose:** Draft an op-ed for Commonwealth Beacon to:
- Make the case for the plan you are developing
- Float some of your ideas as a "trial balloon"
- Test public reaction
- Determine how difficult or easy it will be to explain your plan to the general public and media

- the core problem is that the airport is not in a good location. this is an error of the past that cannot be easily fixed. but it is important to acknowledge this early on, and set up a solution that might go ahead
- while we will focus on the kendall specific for short and medium term solutions, we'll focus on systematic changes for an eventual new airport location in the long term
- stakeholders
	- business / conference travel to and from kendall / cambridge
	- students
	- gate from greater camberville to airport
	- businesses located in kendall
- considerations
	- Red-blue connector is not impactful enough of a difference to be primary solution
		- in my experience, the red blue connector will have minimal benefit for airport travel. the edge case where the tunnel traffic is significantly blocked has been anecdotally rare
	- we're hired by the ksa, but we'll still recommend changes that help all of boston, and not recommend changes that come at the detriment of others
- short term
	- a shuttle to bowdoin
- medium
	- red blue connector?
	- electrify commuter rail, increase frequencies
    - rail from south station to logan
- long
	- north south station connections
	- new airport with commuter line connection
	- increased commuter line frequency to every 15 min
- marketing
	- short / medium
	- long
		- boston airport should be an airport for all of massachussetts
		- romney airport
- claude research things
	- nsrl
	- building an airport along a commuter line in western boston
	- red blue connector expected time savings given my anecdotal evidence

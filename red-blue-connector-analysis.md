# Red-Blue Connector Analysis: Airport Access Benefits

## Overview

The Red-Blue Connector would extend the Blue Line 0.4 miles west from Bowdoin to Charles/MGH, creating a direct Red-Blue transfer. Cost: **$850 million**. Construction: 5 years. Completion estimate: 2030-2031.

## The Core Question: Does This Actually Help Airport Access?

### Current Options from Kendall

| Route | Time | Transfers | Reliability | Cost |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Red → South Station → Silver Line SL1 | ~40 min | 1 | Subject to Ted Williams Tunnel traffic | Free (from airport) |
| Red → Gov't Center → Blue → Airport shuttle | 45+ min | 2 | High (rail) | $2.40 |
| Uber/Lyft | 15-20 min | 0 | Traffic dependent | $25-50+ |

### With Red-Blue Connector

| Route | Time | Transfers | Reliability | Cost |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Red → Charles/MGH → Blue → Airport shuttle | ~25-30 min | 1 | High (rail) | $2.40 |

### Time Savings Analysis

**Claimed benefit:** 10-15 minute improvement over Silver Line route.

**But consider:**
- The Silver Line route is **free** when departing the airport
- Ted Williams Tunnel delays are the main variable - if these are rare (as your anecdotal experience suggests), the Red-Blue Connector's reliability advantage diminishes
- Both routes require a transfer; the connector just changes where
- Both routes still require the Airport Station shuttle to terminals

**Key insight:** If tunnel traffic is rarely a major problem, the Red-Blue Connector primarily offers a small time improvement (~10 min) at a cost of losing the free fare from Logan.

## Broader Boston Benefits (Beyond Kendall)

### Who Actually Benefits Most?

1. **East Boston / Revere / Chelsea → Kendall/Cambridge jobs**
   - Currently: Blue → Gov't Center → Green → Park → Red (2-3 transfers, 40+ min)
   - With connector: Blue → Charles/MGH → Red (1 transfer, ~20 min)
   - **This is the strongest argument** - connects immigrant and working-class communities to job centers

2. **Red Line communities → Government Center / Faneuil Hall**
   - Currently: Red → Park Street → Green (crowded, unreliable)
   - With connector: Red → Charles/MGH → Blue → Gov't Center
   - Modest improvement

3. **Suffolk Downs development access**
   - 10,000 housing units, 25,000 jobs planned at Suffolk Downs (Blue Line)
   - Connector gives Red Line riders direct access

4. **Medical complex access**
   - MGH/Mass Eye and Ear already at Charles/MGH
   - Blue Line communities get better hospital access

### Ridership Projections

- **1987 study:** 9,030 daily trips
- **2010 study:** 18,940 daily trips (2030 projection)

No updated post-COVID projections exist. Remote work trends may significantly reduce these numbers.

## The Skepticism Case

### Arguments Against

1. **Cost-benefit ratio is poor**
   - $850 million for 0.4 miles = ~$2.1 billion per mile
   - For comparison: entire Red Line extension to Alewife (3.2 miles) cost $572 million (1985)
   - MBTA has $25 billion state-of-good-repair backlog

2. **Silver Line already exists**
   - Free from Logan, direct to terminals
   - For Kendall workers, Red → South Station → SL1 is already one transfer
   - Tunnel traffic is the main variable, but if this is rarely bad...

3. **30+ years of broken promises**
   - Promised as Big Dig mitigation in 1990
   - Original completion: 2011
   - Still no construction funding in 2025

4. **Remote work impact**
   - Ridership projections from 2010 don't account for hybrid work
   - Business travel patterns have changed

5. **Better alternatives exist**
   - Electrifying Newburyport/Rockport Line through Lynn
   - Bus rapid transit on Cambridge Street (fraction of cost)
   - Your shuttle idea: Kendall → Bowdoin → Blue Line

### Arguments For

1. **Equity and environmental justice**
   - Connects East Boston, Revere, Chelsea to job centers
   - These are transit-dependent communities
   - Climate benefits from reduced driving

2. **Network completeness**
   - Only two subway lines without direct connection
   - Creates "one-transfer maximum" between any two lines
   - Relieves overcrowding at Downtown Crossing and Park Street

3. **Reliability over speed**
   - Rail is more reliable than bus in tunnel
   - No vulnerability to traffic

## Specific Assessment: Airport Access

### For Kendall Square

**Honest assessment:** Marginal improvement for airport access specifically.

- Saves ~10 minutes vs Silver Line when tunnel traffic is clear
- Loses the free fare from Logan
- Still requires Airport Station shuttle
- The "reliability" argument only matters if tunnel delays are frequent

**Your anecdotal evidence is probably right:** If you rarely experience significant tunnel delays on the Silver Line, the Red-Blue Connector doesn't dramatically improve your Kendall → Logan trip.

### For Rest of Boston

**Modest improvement:**

| Origin | Current Best Route | With Connector | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Harvard/Porter | Red → SS → SL1 (45 min) | Red → Blue (30 min) | ~15 min |
| Alewife | Red → SS → SL1 (50 min) | Red → Blue (35 min) | ~15 min |
| JFK/Ashmont | Red → SS → SL1 (35 min) | Could use either | Minimal |
| Quincy | Red → SS → SL1 (40 min) | Could use either | Minimal |

**Key insight:** The connector mainly benefits the western/northern Red Line communities (Cambridge, Somerville, Arlington). Southern Red Line (Dorchester, Quincy) already has good Silver Line access via South Station.

## Comparison: Shuttle to Bowdoin

Your proposed short-term solution: shuttle from Kendall to Bowdoin.

**Advantages over waiting for connector:**
- Could launch immediately
- Very low cost (existing MassPort shuttle model)
- Tests demand before committing $850M
- No construction disruption
- Flexible - can adjust routing

**Disadvantages:**
- Adds a bus segment (less reliable than pure rail)
- Bowdoin station has limited capacity
- Doesn't help non-Kendall origins

**Assessment:** This is a reasonable short-term experiment. If successful, it demonstrates demand; if unsuccessful, it shows the connector may not be worth the investment.

---

## Bottom Line

### For Kendall → Logan specifically:
The Red-Blue Connector is **not a game-changer** for airport access. It provides a modest time improvement (~10 min) with good reliability, but the Silver Line already exists and is free. Your skepticism appears well-founded.

### For broader Boston:
The connector has **stronger equity and job access arguments** than airport access arguments. The primary beneficiaries are Blue Line communities (East Boston, Revere, Chelsea) gaining access to Cambridge jobs, not Red Line communities gaining airport access.

### For your proposal:
- Don't position the Red-Blue Connector as a primary airport access solution
- Frame it honestly: modest improvement for Kendall, better equity story for Blue Line communities
- The shuttle idea is worth pursuing as a low-cost test
- Focus long-term energy on bigger structural changes (NSRL, new airport location)

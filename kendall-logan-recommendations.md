# Kendall-Logan Access: Creative Solutions Analysis

**Research Date**: December 7, 2025
**Context**: Policy recommendations for Kendall Square Association to improve transit access to Logan Airport

---

## Executive Summary

After extensive research across 8 parallel investigation tracks (water ferry, shuttle/BRT, visionary planning approaches, demand management, alternative airports, emerging technology, international models, and environmental justice), the following recommendations emerged:

**Short-term winner**: Logan Express-style shuttle service from Kendall (Back Bay model proven successful)

**Medium-term priorities**:
1. Red-Blue Connector (already in planning, advocated by Salvucci)
2. Transit signal priority + electric shuttle fleet
3. Regional rail electrification (Fairmount Line pilot underway)

**Long-term vision**: Your instinct on airport relocation + NSRL is sound, but Salvucci's 2024 proposal for a **direct rail tunnel from South Station to Logan** may be more achievable and should be included as an alternative long-term option.

**Critical frame**: All recommendations should be positioned as environmental justice remedies for East Boston (74% minority, 4x asthma rates) rather than airport expansion enablers.

---

## SHORT-TERM SOLUTIONS (0-5 Years)

### 1. KENDALL LOGAN EXPRESS (Highest Priority)

**The Model**: Back Bay Logan Express (proven success)
- $3 to airport, FREE return
- TSA Pre-check priority for riders
- Doubled ridership after 2019 fare reduction
- 2.3M riders system-wide (2024), record growth

**Kendall Implementation**:
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Route | Kendall → Broadway/Main St → Route 1A → Sumner Tunnel → Logan |
| Travel time | 12-15 min off-peak, 20-25 min peak |
| Frequency | Every 30 min (7 days/week) |
| Fare | $3 to Logan, FREE return |
| Pilot cost | $300-400K (6-month peak-only pilot) |
| Full service | $650K-950K/year operating |

**Why this works**:
- MIT students proposed this exact solution (taught by Jim Aloisi, Salvucci colleague)
- Can launch in 3-6 months with existing Logan permit holders
- Proven model with Back Bay success
- Minimal infrastructure required

**Funding sources**:
- Massport (funds entire Logan Express network)
- KSA corporate sponsors (10 companies × $30-40K = pilot funding)
- Rideshare fee increases at Logan

### 2. DEMAND MANAGEMENT (Low-Cost, High-Impact)

**Employer Programs**:
| Initiative | Cost | Impact |
|------------|------|--------|
| Pre-tax transit benefits ($325/month) | $0 to employers | 40% employee savings, 7.65% payroll tax savings for employers |
| Corporate travel policies incentivizing transit | $0 | Policy change only |
| Check & Go baggage promotion | $0 | Already exists at Logan Central Parking |

**Information Campaigns**:
- Real travel time comparisons: "Kendall to Logan: 25 min transit vs 35+ min drive + parking"
- Partner with Massport for accurate Google Maps/Apple Maps routing
- Social media campaign with timed journey videos

**Pricing Interventions**:
- Variable tunnel tolls: $5 peak, $0 off-peak (revenue funds transit)
- Dynamic Logan parking pricing
- Heathrow-style terminal drop-off charge (~$9)

**Quick win**: Partner with Check & Go remote baggage check (already FREE at Logan) - reduces "last-mile luggage burden" for transit users.

---

### 3. ELECTRIC SHUTTLE WITH TRANSIT SIGNAL PRIORITY

**Technology Solution** (can deploy in 2-3 years):
| Component | Cost | Benefit |
|-----------|------|---------|
| 5-bus electric fleet | $5-6M | Zero emissions, climate messaging |
| Charging infrastructure | $1M | Fast charging at Kendall terminal |
| Transit Signal Priority | $400-600K | 25% travel time reduction (proven) |
| **Total** | **$6-7M** | Competitive, sustainable service |

**Funding**: FAA Zero Emission Vehicle grants ($1.5M precedent), MassCEC, MassDOT

**Why this over AV/eVTOL**:
- Electric buses are mature technology (deployable now)
- AV shuttles realistic by 2030+ (Massachusetts currently requires driver)
- eVTOL too expensive ($100-300/trip), wrong distance (2 miles too short)

---

### 4. NOT RECOMMENDED: WATER FERRY

**Research finding**: Infeasible due to Charles River Dam locks

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Travel time | 40-70 minutes (vs 9-44 min alternatives) |
| Lock passage | 10-30 minute bottleneck, unavoidable |
| Capital cost | $15-52M for inferior service |
| Seasonal | Winter ice prevents year-round operation |

**Conclusion**: Better as part of broader Charles River ferry network (scenic/tourist focus), not airport access.

---

## MEDIUM-TERM SOLUTIONS (5-15 Years)

### 1. RED-BLUE CONNECTOR (Already in Motion)

**Current status**: Funded through 30% design, $850M total estimated

**Why it matters for Kendall-Logan**:
- Direct Red Line to Blue Line connection
- One-seat ride from Kendall to Airport station
- TransitMatters: "Everyone working in Kendall seeking access to Logan will be able to ditch Uber and Lyft"

**Salvucci position**: "The need for this is urgent. We need this."

**Coalition to build** (Salvucci "retail" approach):
| Stakeholder | Frame |
|-------------|-------|
| East Boston community | EJ remedy, job access to Kendall, reduced TNC traffic |
| Kendall Square employers | Talent recruitment, airport access |
| MGH/Partners | Healthcare access |
| Environmental groups | Climate, mode shift |
| Conservation Law Foundation | Original Big Dig mitigation (they sued for this) |

**Key political allies**: Rep. Adrian Madaro (Vice Chair Transportation), Councilor Gabriela Coletta

---

### 2. REGIONAL RAIL ELECTRIFICATION

**TransitMatters 2024 victory**: Fairmount Line battery-electric trains approved (2028)

**2025 CIP**: $61M new funding for Regional Rail, including $2M for electrification planning on Eastern Route (Boston-Beverly)

**Why it matters**:
- 30x more reliable than diesel locomotives
- Enables 15-minute frequencies (competitive with driving)
- Prepares for eventual NSRL integration

**Schiphol comparison**: Netherlands (2x size of MA) achieves 47% airport modal share with 8 trains/hour frequency. Current MBTA: hourly or worse.

---

### 3. GRAND JUNCTION LINE

**What it is**: Freight corridor connecting Kendall to Allston/Worcester Line

**Potential**: Direct rail from Kendall to South Station (connecting to SL1 for Logan)

**Cost estimate**: $300-400M

**Why prioritize over regional airports**: Grand Junction improves access to Logan (100% of destinations) vs regional airports (only 40-50% - no West Coast service for tech workers).

---

### 4. NOT RECOMMENDED: ALTERNATIVE AIRPORTS AS PRIMARY SOLUTION

**Research finding**: Regional airports CANNOT replace Logan for Kendall workers

| Airport | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| Manchester (MHT) | No SF, Seattle, LA routes; Capitol Corridor rail stalled |
| Worcester (ORH) | Only 204K passengers, struggling to attract airlines |
| Providence (PVD) | Amtrak direct service only in planning, no timeline |
| Hanscom (BED) | Political opposition "strongest in state" (Emerson/Thoreau descendants leading opposition) |

**Critical gap**: Tech workers need West Coast routes (SF = 33% of US AI investment, Seattle = Amazon/Microsoft). ONLY Logan serves these.

**Verdict**: Regional airports can serve 15-25% of travel (East Coast + Florida), but not the core Kendall business travel needs.

---

## LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS (50+ Years)

### 1. YOUR VISION: AIRPORT RELOCATION + NSRL

**Alignment with existing research**: Your instinct aligns with the northern airport research already completed. Beverly Regional Airport emerged as most viable expansion candidate (growing rapidly, good rail access potential).

**The case**:
- Logan in wrong location (too close to downtown, EJ impacts)
- Netherlands (2x size of MA) serves entire country via one rail-connected airport
- Western MA / northern airport could serve entire state if properly connected

**Political framing** (from your notes): "Boston airport should be an airport for all of Massachusetts"

---

### 2. SALVUCCI'S 2024 PROPOSAL: DIRECT RAIL TUNNEL TO LOGAN

**Quote from CommonWealth Beacon (Jan 2024)**:
> "Massport should partner with MassDOT and the MBTA to expand passenger rail capacity from South Station, **including consideration of a new rail tunnel to Logan**"

**Why consider this alternative to relocation**:
- Builds on existing infrastructure (South Station, NSRL planning)
- Could be fourth harbor crossing (following Big Dig precedent)
- Potentially achievable in 15-25 year horizon (faster than new airport)
- Salvucci coalition-building model already proven

**Comparison**:
| Option | Timeline | Cost (rough) | Benefit |
|--------|----------|--------------|---------|
| Airport relocation | 50+ years | $10-20B+ | Serves whole state, eliminates East Boston burden |
| Rail tunnel to Logan | 15-25 years | $5-10B | Direct rail access, keeps Logan |

**Recommendation**: Keep airport relocation as ultimate long-term vision, but advocate for rail tunnel to Logan as "medium-long" bridge solution that addresses immediate access problems while preserving optionality.

---

### 3. NEW ENGLAND REGIONAL AIRPORT AUTHORITY

**Concept** (advocated by Salvucci and others, 2024):
- Coordinate Logan, Manchester, T.F. Green, Worcester, Bradley
- Model: NY-NJ Port Authority (operates JFK, LaGuardia, Newark)
- Reduce Logan congestion by distributing regional traffic

**Current problem**: Three airports operate independently and competitively, each driven by individual financial bottom lines vs. regional transportation needs.

**Benefits**: Better serve North Shore, Merrimack Valley, Southern NH populations; reduce highway congestion; environmental benefits.

---

## ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FRAMING

### East Boston Context (Critical for Political Support)

| Metric | East Boston Reality |
|--------|---------------------|
| Demographics | 74% minority, 53% Latino/Hispanic |
| Income | 44% of state median |
| Pollution | 35,000+ lbs daily from airport |
| Health | Children 4x more likely to have asthma |
| Transit dependence | 70% use public transit as primary mode |

### Coalition Partners
- **GreenRoots**: 30-year EJ organization, 2024 transportation grant recipient
- **Airport Impact Relief (AIR Inc.)**: Founded 1981, longest-serving airport advocacy
- **Logan Community Clean Air Coalition**

### Political Champions
- **Rep. Adrian Madaro**: House Vice Chair of Transportation, filed bills to reduce TNC deadheading (5 million empty trips through East Boston annually)
- **Councilor Gabriela Coletta**: Strong transit advocate

### How to Frame Recommendations

**DO say**:
- "Environmental justice remedy for decades of pollution burden"
- "Better job access for East Boston residents to Kendall Square"
- "Reduce 12 million annual TNC trips through East Boston"
- "Community benefit first, not just airport travelers"

**DON'T say**:
- "Enable airport growth/expansion"
- "Make it easier to fly" (without EJ context)

**Quantify**: Mode shift from cars to transit = reduced ultrafine particulate pollution in already-overburdened community.

## LESSONS FROM INTERNATIONAL MODELS

### What Works (40-60% Modal Share Achievable)

| Airport | Key Success Factor |
|---------|-------------------|
| Oslo (70% modal share) | 160 km/h rail, 19-minute travel time |
| Zurich | Same fare as all transit (no premium) |
| Copenhagen | Metro added to existing waterfront airport 50+ years after opening |
| Schiphol | 8 trains/hour frequency, 24-hour service |

### What Fails

| Project | Failure | Lesson |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Oakland BART | $6 surcharge + 2 transfers | No premium pricing, minimize transfers |
| Stockholm Arlanda | €30 fare | Affordable fares matter |
| Sydney Airport Link | PPP bankruptcy | Avoid bad PPP contracts |
| Newark AirTrain | 75% cost overrun | Realistic cost estimates |

### Key Principles for Boston
1. **No surcharges** - Oakland's $6 fee killed ridership
2. **Minimize transfers** - One-seat rides where possible
3. **Frequency > speed** - Schedule-independent (every 5-8 min)
4. **Serve multiple markets** - Passengers + workers + residents
5. **Integration** - Same fare system, real-time info

## SALVUCCI'S PLAYBOOK: HOW TO BUILD POLITICAL WILL

**Fred Salvucci's core lesson**: "Part of his genius is finding ways to actually accomplish something that most people would view as totally impossible."

### Key Tactics

1. **"Retail rather than wholesale"** - Engage every constituency directly, not just power brokers

2. **Invite skeptics to collaborate on data** - Salvucci invited critics to help with cost assessments, earning trust

3. **Build bipartisan coalitions** - Big Dig succeeded with Republican Governor + Democratic Congressional leadership

4. **Link to existing commitments** - Red-Blue was Big Dig mitigation; link new proposals to climate goals, EJ commitments

5. **Accept that projects take decades** - "Conceived under one administration, designed under a second, built under a third and opened under a fourth"

### Framing for Kendall-Logan

**NOT**: "Kendall needs better airport access"

**INSTEAD**: "Environmental justice communities in East Boston deserve clean air. Kendall Square workers deserve climate-friendly commutes. Logan Airport's success depends on reducing auto congestion. A direct transit connection solves all three problems while positioning Greater Boston for another century of global leadership."

# New Massachusetts Regional Airport: 50-Year Vision Research

## Executive Summary

This research explores whether Massachusetts could build a new rail-connected regional airport to replace or supplement Logan. Using Amsterdam Schiphol as the model (9 miles from city center, 47% transit mode share), we analyze whether a similarly close location is achievable in Greater Boston.

**Key Finding:** There is no available site within 20 miles of Boston with sufficient land for a major airport. The closest viable options are 25-40 miles out, which with electrified rail could achieve 25-40 minute travel times - acceptable but not Schiphol-level.

---

## Part 1: The Amsterdam Schiphol Model

### Why Schiphol Matters

Schiphol demonstrates that a single national airport can serve an entire country via rail:
- **Netherlands:** 41,543 km² (16,040 sq mi), 17.8 million people
- **Massachusetts:** 20,306 km² (7,840 sq mi), 6.5 million people
- **Ratio:** Netherlands is only 2x larger than MA

If Schiphol can serve 17.8M Dutch via rail, a MA airport could serve 6.5M.

### Schiphol Key Metrics

| Metric | Schiphol |
|--------|----------|
| **Distance from Amsterdam** | 15-17 km (9-11 miles) |
| **Train time to city center** | 14-17 minutes |
| **Train frequency** | 8 trains/hour (every 7-8 min) |
| **24-hour service** | Yes (hourly 1-5 AM) |
| **Transit mode share** | 47% |
| **Station design** | Underground, beneath terminal |
| **Passengers** | 67.8 million (2024) |

### What Makes Schiphol Work

1. **9 miles is close** - Still essentially in the metro area
2. **14-17 min is competitive with driving** - No advantage to car
3. **8 trains/hour** - Never wait more than 7-8 minutes
4. **Underground station** - Seamless terminal integration
5. **Serves whole country** - Not just Amsterdam; direct trains to all cities

---

## Part 2: The Distance Problem - Can We Match Schiphol?

### The Honest Answer: No

**Schiphol is 9 miles from Amsterdam. There is no location 9 miles from Boston with:**
- 1,000+ acres available for airport development
- Existing or buildable rail connection
- Political viability

**Why?** Boston's suburbs developed before aviation became dominant. All land within 15-20 miles is either:
- Dense residential neighborhoods
- Protected conservation/wetlands
- Already developed commercial/industrial
- Owned by wealthy communities that will fight

### What's Within Schiphol-Equivalent Distance (9-15 miles)?

| Location | Distance | Status | Rail Access | Verdict |
|----------|----------|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Logan Airport** | 3 miles | Existing | Blue Line, future Red-Blue | Already closer than Schiphol! |
| **Hanscom Field** | 14 miles | Existing GA airport | None (5-7 mi from station) | Political nightmare |
| **Beverly Regional** | 14 miles | Growing GA | 3 mi from Beverly Station | Best close-in option |
| **South Weymouth NAS** | 15 miles | CLOSED 1997 | Was on Old Colony Lines | Now housing (Southfield) |
| **Norwood Memorial** | 15 miles | Small GA | Near Franklin Line | Too constrained |
| **Readville area** | 8-10 miles | Industrial | Fairmount Line | Way too small |

**The irony:** Logan at 3 miles from downtown is CLOSER than Schiphol. The problem isn't distance - it's that Logan can't expand and has poor rail access.

### Hanscom: The "Obvious" Location That's Impossible

Hanscom Field in Bedford seems ideal:
- 14 miles from Boston (Schiphol-like distance)
- Existing 7,011 ft runway
- 1,125 acres
- Massport-owned

**Why it will never happen:**
- Surrounded by Bedford, Lexington, Lincoln, Concord (wealthy, politically powerful)
- 2024: State rejected even modest private jet hangar expansion
- Environmental constraints (wetlands, Superfund site, protected species)
- No commuter rail (would need 5-7 mile new rail spur)
- Decades of organized opposition

**Political reality:** Hanscom expansion is a non-starter regardless of merit.

### Beverly: The Most Realistic Close-In Option

Beverly Regional Airport:
- 14 miles from Boston
- 3 miles from Beverly Station (existing Newburyport/Rockport Line)
- Rapidly growing (#9 → #2 in MA general aviation in 3 years)
- Airport manager "preparing to provide" commuter service
- Less political opposition than Hanscom

**Limitations:**
- Currently general aviation only (short runways)
- North of Boston only - doesn't serve South Shore, MetroWest, Worcester
- Would need major expansion ($1B+)
- Serves ~600K population directly

**Travel time potential:**
- Current to North Station: ~45 min (many stops)
- With electrification + express: ~20-25 min

**Assessment:** Beverly could work as a secondary airport for North Shore but can't replace Logan as primary regional airport.

---

## Part 3: What About Further Out?

If close-in is impossible, what's the minimum viable distance?

### Rail Speed Reality

| Track Type | Average Speed | 30 mi = | 40 mi = |
|------------|---------------|---------|---------|
| Current MBTA diesel | 30-35 mph | 55-60 min | 70-80 min |
| Electrified regional (NJ Transit-level) | 50-60 mph | 30-35 min | 40-50 min |
| High-performance electrified (Schiphol-level) | 70-80 mph | 23-26 min | 30-35 min |

**Key insight:** Electrification + express service could cut travel times by 40-50%.

### Distance/Time Analysis with Electrification

| Location | Distance | Current Time | Electrified Express |
|----------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Beverly | 14 mi | 45 min | **20-25 min** ✓ |
| Framingham area | 22 mi | 40 min | **25-30 min** ✓ |
| Foxborough/I-95 | 25 mi | N/A | **25-30 min** ✓ |
| Worcester | 45 mi | 90 min | **40-45 min** |
| Devens | 40 mi | 75 min | **35-40 min** |

**To achieve <45 min from downtown Boston with electrified rail:**
- Maximum distance: ~40 miles at 60 mph average
- Maximum distance: ~50 miles at 80 mph average

### Mid-Distance Options (20-30 miles)

**Framingham/MetroWest area (20-22 mi):**
- Worcester Line has strong service
- Could achieve 25-30 min with electrification
- **Problem:** No large available parcels
- **Problem:** Sudbury River watershed (environmental constraints)
- **Verdict:** No suitable site exists

**Foxborough/Sharon area (25 mi):**
- Near Providence/Stoughton Line with I-95 access
- Some large parcels near Gillette Stadium
- Could achieve 25-30 min with electrification
- **Problem:** Competes with T.F. Green (60 mi south, already has rail)
- **Problem:** Suburban opposition likely
- **Verdict:** Possible but redundant

**I-495 Corridor general:**
- Ring highway suggests potential sites
- Westborough, Marlborough, Hopkinton areas
- **Problem:** Most land developed for tech/biotech
- **Problem:** Environmental constraints (ACECs)
- **Verdict:** No large sites remain

### Far Distance Options (35-45 miles)

**Fort Devens (35-40 mi):**
- 4,400 acres (though much now developed)
- Moore Army Airfield had 5,200 ft runway
- State-owned (MassDevelopment) - simpler permitting
- Fitchburg Line serves Ayer/Shirley stations
- Could achieve 35-40 min with electrification

**Pros:**
- Largest available land
- State ownership
- Direct existing rail
- Low land cost
- Serves underserved Central MA

**Cons:**
- 35-40 min minimum travel time
- Much land already committed to development
- Fitchburg Line needs major upgrades

**Worcester Regional (45 mi):**
- Already operational commercial airport
- Massport-owned
- 229K passengers (2024)
- Could achieve 40-45 min with electrification

**Critical gap:** No rail connection to airport (several miles from Union Station)

---

## Part 4: Honest Assessment - What's Achievable?

### The <1 Hour Target

**Can we achieve <1 hour travel time from "all of Boston"?**

| Origin | To Devens (40 mi) | To Beverly (14 mi) | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------| ------|
| Downtown Boston | 35-40 min | 20-25 min | With electrification |
| Cambridge/Kendall | 30-35 min | 25-30 min | Via NSRL |
| South Boston | 40-45 min | 30-35 min | Via NSRL |
| Back Bay | 35-40 min | 25-30 min | Via NSRL |
| Jamaica Plain | 45-50 min | 35-40 min | Transfer needed |

**Devens** can achieve <45 min from most of Boston proper with electrification.
**Beverly** can achieve <30 min but only serves one direction.

### The "No Perfect Answer" Reality

**There is no site that is:**
1. Close enough for Schiphol-like travel times (15-20 min)
2. Has available land for a major airport
3. Has existing or easy rail access
4. Is politically achievable

**We have to choose between:**
- **Close but constrained:** Beverly (14 mi), serves north only
- **Available but far:** Devens (40 mi), serves west/central
- **Existing but out-of-state:** T.F. Green (60 mi), serves south

### What About Building New Rail?

Could we build new rail to a closer greenfield site?

**Theoretical "ideal" site:** ~20-25 miles west, along I-90 corridor

**Cost reality:**
- New rail line: $100-500M per mile in US
- 10-mile new rail spur: $1-5 billion
- Plus airport construction: $10-20 billion
- Total: $15-25 billion

This is North-South Rail Link territory ($8-21B). You'd be building two megaprojects simultaneously.

---

## Part 5: The Schiphol Comparison Reconsidered

### Schiphol's Advantages We Can't Replicate

1. **Built when land was available** (1920s origins, major expansion post-WWII)
2. **Flat terrain** (Netherlands is famously flat)
3. **National consensus** (small country, one major airport strategy)
4. **Early rail integration** (station built with 1995 terminal expansion)

### What We CAN Replicate

1. **High-frequency rail** - 4-8 trains/hour is achievable with investment
2. **24-hour service** - Policy choice, not infrastructure
3. **Underground station** - Build it right the first time
4. **National/state airport framing** - Marketing strategy

### Adjusted Expectations

| Metric | Schiphol | Realistic MA Goal |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Distance | 9 mi | 25-40 mi |
| Train time | 14-17 min | 25-40 min |
| Frequency | 8 trains/hr | 4 trains/hr |
| Mode share | 47% | 30-40% |

**A 25-40 minute rail journey is still competitive** if:
- Trains run frequently (every 15 min)
- Service is reliable
- Station is at terminal (not separate with shuttle)
- Driving/parking takes similar time with traffic

---

## Part 6: Recommendations

### Tier 1: Most Realistic (25-40 mile range)

**Option A: Enhanced Devens**
- Distance: 40 miles
- Travel time: 35-40 min (electrified)
- Land: Available (with negotiation)
- Rail: Fitchburg Line (needs upgrades)
- Serves: Central MA, MetroWest, Boston

**Option B: Worcester Regional + Rail Connection**
- Distance: 45 miles
- Travel time: 40-45 min (electrified)
- Land: Already an airport
- Rail: Need 3-5 mile spur from Union Station
- Serves: Central/Western MA, MetroWest

### Tier 2: Supplementary Closer Options

**Beverly Regional Expansion**
- Distance: 14 miles
- Travel time: 20-25 min (electrified)
- Limitation: North Shore only
- Role: Secondary airport for regional/domestic

**T.F. Green Enhancement**
- Distance: 60 miles
- Travel time: 75-90 min (current), could be 50-60 min
- Limitation: Rhode Island (interstate coordination)
- Role: Already functioning as Boston's second airport

### Tier 3: Fantasy (Mentioned for Completeness)

**Hanscom Conversion**
- Would be ideal (14 mi, Schiphol-like)
- Politically impossible for foreseeable future
- Only viable after decades of political change

---

## Part 7: Key Takeaways for Policy Memo

### The Honest Message

1. **Logan is actually well-located** (3 mi from downtown - closer than Schiphol!)
   - Problem is capacity and rail access, not distance
   - Red-Blue Connector would dramatically improve access

2. **There is no "Schiphol-equivalent" site available** in Greater Boston
   - All close-in land is developed
   - Political opposition in wealthy suburbs is insurmountable

3. **35-40 minutes is achievable and acceptable**
   - Many world cities have 30-45 min airport rail journeys
   - Key is frequency and reliability, not distance

4. **Electrification is the game-changer**
   - Cuts travel times 40-50%
   - Makes Devens/Worcester viable at 35-45 min

5. **Multi-airport regional system may be better than single new airport**
   - Beverly (north), Logan (central), T.F. Green (south), Worcester (west)
   - Each with good rail connection
   - Distributes load, provides redundancy

### The 50-Year Vision Framing

**Short-term (0-10 years):**
- Red-Blue Connector (improve Logan access)
- Electrify Worcester/Providence lines
- Enhance T.F. Green rail service

**Medium-term (10-25 years):**
- Build NSRL (enables through-running)
- Expand Beverly Regional with rail connection
- Develop Worcester Regional with rail spur

**Long-term (25-50 years):**
- Evaluate Devens or similar for major new airport
- Depends on Logan capacity, regional growth
- Keep large land parcels preserved (don't develop Devens fully)

## Part 8: Why This Matters for Kendall Square and Boston

### The Kendall-Specific Case

**Current Kendall → Logan pain points:**
1. Red Line to Blue Line requires walking through Downtown Crossing (no direct transfer)
2. Red Line to Silver Line requires transfer at South Station + slow surface bus
3. Most Kendall workers take Uber/Lyft ($30-50+) or drive
4. Congestion in tunnels makes driving unreliable
5. No Logan Express serves Kendall

**This is why KSA is asking for solutions in the first place.**

### How NSRL Changes Everything for Kendall

With North-South Rail Link, the Red Line would connect to ALL commuter rail lines via through-running or easy transfers at a unified downtown station complex.

**Kendall → Airport travel times with NSRL + electrification:**

| Destination | Current | With NSRL + Electrified Rail |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Logan (via Red-Blue)** | 40-50 min | 25-30 min |
| **Devens Airport** | N/A | **35-40 min (one-seat)** |
| **Worcester Airport** | N/A | **40-45 min (one-seat)** |
| **Beverly Airport** | 60+ min (transfers) | **30-35 min (one-seat via NSRL)** |
| **T.F. Green** | 90+ min | **60-70 min (one-seat via NSRL)** |

**Key insight:** A Western airport + NSRL gives Kendall workers a ONE-SEAT ride to the airport that's COMPETITIVE with Logan.

### The Kendall Advantage Calculation

**Current Kendall → Logan options:**

| Mode | Time | Cost | Reliability |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| Uber/Lyft | 15-40 min | $30-50 | Variable (traffic) |
| Red + Blue Line | 35-45 min | $2.90 | Poor (transfers, luggage) |
| Red + Silver Line | 45-55 min | $2.90 | Poor (slow Silver Line) |

**Future Kendall → Western Airport (with NSRL):**

| Mode | Time | Cost | Reliability |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| Direct train | 35-45 min | ~$10 | High (dedicated ROW) |

**The value proposition:** Kendall workers get a reliable, predictable, comfortable one-seat ride to the airport for ~$10. No traffic. No luggage transfers. No Uber surge pricing.

### Why Biotech/Tech Workers Care

Kendall Square is:
- #1 biotech hub globally
- Home to Google, Microsoft, Novartis, Moderna, etc.
- 50,000+ workers (and growing)
- High percentage of business travelers

**Business traveler priorities:**
1. Reliability (can't miss flights)
2. Productivity (work on train vs. drive in traffic)
3. Cost predictability (corporate expense policies)

A rail-connected airport matches all three priorities better than Logan + Uber.

### The "Kendall as Gateway" Framing

With NSRL, Kendall/MIT station becomes a **gateway node**:
- Red Line from Cambridge, Somerville, Dorchester, Quincy
- Through-running to ALL commuter rail lines
- Direct service to Western airport

**Kendall workers could board at Kendall and ride directly to the airport** - no Downtown Crossing maze, no Silver Line surface traffic, no tunnel congestion.

This is actually BETTER access than most Boston neighborhoods currently have to Logan.

---

## Part 9: Boston-Wide Benefits

### Who in Boston Benefits from Western Airport?

**Neighborhoods with NSRL-enabled one-seat airport access:**

| Neighborhood | Current Line | NSRL Connection | Benefit |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Cambridge/Kendall | Red Line | Direct to Fitchburg/Worcester | Major |
| Somerville | Green Line Extension | Via NSRL | Major |
| Back Bay | Orange Line | Via NSRL | Moderate |
| South End | Orange Line | Via NSRL | Moderate |
| Jamaica Plain | Orange Line | Via NSRL | Moderate |
| Dorchester | Red Line | Direct to Fitchburg/Worcester | Major |
| Quincy | Red Line | Direct to Fitchburg/Worcester | Major |
| Allston/Brighton | Green Line B | Via NSRL | Moderate |

**Key insight:** The Red Line corridor (Cambridge → Quincy) benefits most because it connects directly to both North Station (Fitchburg Line) and South Station (Worcester Line) via NSRL.

### The Environmental Justice Angle

**Current Logan burden falls on East Boston:**
- 15 tons pollutants daily
- Noise impacts on EJ community
- Tunnel traffic through neighborhood

**Western airport redistributes:**
- Flights over less dense areas
- Rail access means less car traffic overall
- East Boston gets relief

This aligns with state environmental justice priorities.

### Congestion Relief

**Current tunnel capacity is exhausted:**
- Sumner/Callahan/Ted Williams all at capacity
- Big Dig benefit "fully utilized"
- Every additional Logan passenger adds road congestion

**Rail-accessed Western airport:**
- Zero tunnel impact
- Passengers on rail don't use roads
- Could actually reduce Logan demand

---

## Part 10: Revised Recommendations for KSA

### The Phased Pitch

**For the policy memo, frame the long-term vision as:**

**Phase 1 (0-5 years): Quick wins**
- Logan Express to Kendall (immediate relief)
- Red-Blue Connector advocacy
- Enhanced Blue Line service

**Phase 2 (5-15 years): NSRL foundation**
- Build North-South Rail Link
- Electrify Worcester and Fitchburg lines
- This enables all future options

**Phase 3 (15-30 years): Regional airport network**
- Develop Western airport (Devens or similar) with NSRL connection
- Kendall workers get one-seat ride to new airport
- Logan becomes more focused (international, business shuttle)
- Regional system reduces pressure on any single facility

**Phase 4 (30-50 years): Optimization**
- Evaluate which facilities need expansion
- Adjust service patterns based on demand
- Potential Logan → more rail-oriented (like Schiphol model)

### The Kendall-Specific Ask

**For KSA's stakeholder conversations:**

1. **With Massport:** "We support a regional airport strategy that includes rail connectivity. A Western airport with NSRL access would serve Kendall workers better than Logan does today."

2. **With MassDOT:** "NSRL isn't just about commuter rail - it's about airport access for the entire Boston core. Kendall's 50,000+ workers would benefit from one-seat airport rides."

3. **With MBTA:** "Electrification + NSRL would make Kendall a hub for airport access, not a dead-end that requires Uber to reach Logan."

4. **With Boston/Cambridge:** "A Western airport reduces pressure on East Boston and the tunnels while giving Cambridge residents better airport access than they have today."

### Why This Benefits Boston (Not Just Worcester)

The counter-argument: "Why should Boston care about a Western airport? Logan is closer."

**The response:**

1. **Logan can't expand** - It's at capacity on 2,400 acres of landfill
2. **Tunnel capacity is exhausted** - Every additional passenger adds congestion
3. **Rail is faster than traffic** - 40 min by train beats 60 min in tunnel traffic
4. **Reliability matters more than distance** - Business travelers need predictable travel time
5. **One-seat ride beats transfers** - Kendall → Devens direct is better than Kendall → Downtown Crossing → Blue Line → Airport shuttle

**For many Boston trips, a 40-minute direct train beats a 25-minute drive that could be 60 minutes in traffic.**

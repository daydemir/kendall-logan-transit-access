## Brief

In order to improve access between Kendall Square (Kendall) and Boston Logan Airport (Logan), we propose a two-phased approach. In the first phase, precisely targeted shuttles and investment in the Red-Blue Connector will maximize short-term access efficiency between Logan and Kendall. In the second phase, investing in electrified commuter rail and strategically gathering political momentum will lead to the building of a new rail-connected airport that will better serve Boston and Massachusetts, while unlocking huge adaptive reuse opportunities for East Boston and a one-seat electrified rail connection from Kendall to the new airport.

## Stakeholders

Business Travelers & Workers (~50,000)
  - 50,000 people work in Kendall Square daily across 250+ biotech companies and 450+ startups
  - Major employers include Harvard, MIT, Biogen, and Takeda with high-frequency business travel needs
  - 575,000 convention room nights booked for 2025 reflect constant flow of visiting professionals

  Residents (~200,000)
  - East Cambridge has 12,555 residents; neighboring Somerville, Medford, and Arlington add 187,000 more
  - 75% are renters with median age of 30, indicating a mobile population likely to fly frequently
  - Personal travel for family visits, vacations, and relocations drives periodic airport demand

  Students (~48,000)
  - Harvard (24,519) and MIT (11,816) anchor a student population of nearly 48,000 in Cambridge
  - Seasonal surge travel during December, May, and August breaks concentrates demand
  - High proportion of international students require long-haul flights home multiple times per year

There are three key stakeholder groups that must be considered.

Business Travelers and Conference-goers (100 words)
Kendall Square hosts over 50,000 daily workers across hundreds of companies.  Kendall Square is a hub for many companies and businesses. The large number of companies, ranging from startups to larger established companies, makes it important to consider the specific ways that businesses travelers need to use the airport.

## Problem

Kendall Square (Kendall) is a vital hub for the region. The area hosts hundreds of companies and is centrally located to many of the areas educational institutions. Demand for air travel is generally increasing, and those affiliated with the businesses and academic institutions are some of the most frequent users of air travel. 

If we don't want Kendall's roads to be clogged, and require half of Kendall's real estate to be dedicated to parking and ride share drop off and pickup, then we need to increase the mass transit mode share for trips between Kendall and Logan.

Given this, we can summarize the problems with existing transit between Kendall and Logan as follows.

**Transit Problem 1: Too many transfers**. No one-seat ride, and the only grade-separated option involves two transfers, not including the transfer to the airport shuttle from the Airport Station on the Blue Line. This inefficiency causes the grade-separated option (Red to Orange to Blue Line)to usually be slower than the one-transfer but only partially grade-separated option (Red to Silver Line).
**Transit Problem 2: Gets stuck in traffic**. The Red to Silver Line route only involves one transfer, but the Silver Line 1 (SL1) is not grade-separated in the Callahan Tunnel. Because of this, the Red to Silver Line route has almost no opportunity to beat driving on travel time, since any advantage of prior grade-separation gets lost in the tunnel. 

We should also take on three more systematic problems that loom over Boston and all airport access in general, and see what solutions may exist that also benefit Kendall.

**Airport Problem 1: Over capacity and growing**. The airport has already well-surpassed its original design capacity, and at a modest air travel growth rate of 3.5% per year Logan will maximum capacity by 2032. Besides this, the capacity of the roads and transit systems that lead to Logan are also stretched. If Logan is to remain a usable airport past the next decade, significant investments will need to be made to managing capacity of access and of the airport itself.

**Airport Problem 2: Problematic location**. There are many reasons why the existing airport location is severly sub-optimal. The airport causes East Boston residents to suffer residual economic and air quality harms. The waterfront location makes it extremely vulnerable to impacts from climate change, and the existing location will require immense amounts of investment to made resilient to rising sea levels. The densities and waterways surrounding the airport make either very expensive or impossible to expand the footprint, and they make it logistically very difficult to build new transit options to the airport.

In Phase 1, we suggest solutions that address Transit Problems 1 and 2, and in Phase 2 we suggest solutions that address Airport Problems 1 and 2.


## Solutions

Two horizons of solutions

### Maximize Logan over the next 10 years
#### Solution
Blue Line Connector (1 year): One shuttle to the blue line, every 15 min, prove demand for red-blue connector

Kendall Logan Express (2 years): One Logan Express style shuttle to the airport and back, one seat ride for ~$10, every 30 min

Red-Blue Connector (10 years): more than just for the kendall airport

Recommend against building airport specific infrastructure across the Charles

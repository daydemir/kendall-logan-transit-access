# North-South Rail Link (NSRL) Research

## Overview
The North-South Rail Link is a proposed ~1.5 mile rail tunnel connecting North Station and South Station in downtown Boston. It would unify the currently separate northern and southern commuter rail networks and enable through-running Amtrak service from New York to Maine.

---

## Current Status (as of December 2024)

**The project is NOT currently active, funded, or in planning.**

- **No active development**: MassDOT confirmed in March 2024 that "currently there is no new study planned regarding creating passenger rail service between South Station and North Station in Boston"
- **Not funded**: No construction funding allocated at state or federal levels
- **Alternative being pursued**: Healey administration pursuing South Station expansion instead
- **Last official study**: MassDOT Feasibility Reassessment completed January 2019

### Recent Developments (2024)
- Rep. Seth Moulton commissioned new Harvard Kennedy School study (June 2024) estimating $8 billion cost with $30 billion in benefits
- Former Governor Dukakis publicly opposed South Station expansion as "wrong-headed waste of money band-aid idea" (December 2024)
- Rep. Stephen Lynch stated it would be "quite difficult to obtain significant federal funding"

## Cost Estimates

| Study | Year | Estimate | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Harvard Kennedy School | 2017 | $3.8-5.9 billion | 2025 dollars, independent analysis |
| MassDOT Feasibility Study | 2018 | $12.3-21.5 billion | 2028 dollars, official state study |
| Moulton-commissioned (Harvard) | 2024 | $7.9-8 billion | Updated estimate |

**Why the huge range?** Different assumptions about:
- Tunnel configurations (2 vs 4 tracks)
- Station depths and locations
- Contingency factors
- Rolling stock and electrification costs

## Projected Benefits (2024 Harvard Study)

- **Economic benefits**: $28-31 billion over 20 years
- **Benefit-cost ratio**: ~3.6-3.9 to 1
- **Ridership**: 86 million new rides annually (quadrupling current commuter rail ridership)
- **Fare revenue**: $7 billion additional over 20 years
- **Housing**: Would incentivize 150,000+ new housing units
- **Transit-oriented development**: $5.8-8.7 billion in new development

**Comparison**: South Station expansion alone would deliver only $3 billion in net benefits.

## Engineering Challenges

### Tunnel Depth
- **Station depths**: 115-195 feet below surface (deeper than Porter Square at 105 feet)
- **Reason**: Must clear existing infrastructure (subways and Big Dig tunnels)
- **Descent**: Trains would descend at 3% grade starting ~4,700 feet from stations

### Geological Conditions
- Must bore through Boston Blue Clay
- Big Dig left slurry walls that create more stable tunneling conditions
- Big Dig reserved space underground for future rail bores

### Existing Infrastructure Conflicts
- Would pass ~20 feet beneath I-90 extension
- Must navigate around Red Line, Orange Line, Green Line, Blue Line, Silver Line
- Strategy: Go deep enough to pass below all existing subway infrastructure

### Five Portals Required
1. Two at North Point (Fitchburg Line and northern lines)
2. One at Back Bay (Worcester and Amtrak)
3. Two at South Bay (Old Colony and Dorchester Branch)

### Electrification Requirement
- Tunnels cannot handle diesel locomotives
- Requires dual-mode locomotives OR electrification of commuter rail lines

### Construction Disruption
- Back Bay portal construction would disrupt Worcester Line and Amtrak Lake Shore Limited for ~2 years

## Political Landscape

### Supporters
**Federal:**
- Rep. Seth Moulton (MA-6) - primary champion
- Senator Edward Markey
- Reps. Katherine Clark, Jim McGovern

**State:**
- 175 state legislators signed letter of support
- Former Governors Michael Dukakis and William Weld

**Municipal:**
- Mayor Michelle Wu (Boston)
- 25+ mayors (Cambridge, Worcester, Springfield, Salem, Somerville, etc.)

**Advocacy Groups:**
- TransitMatters
- Sierra Club Massachusetts
- Citizens for the North South Rail Link
- A Better City

### Opposition/Skeptics
- Healey administration (prioritizing other projects)
- Rep. William Straus (Boston Globe op-ed, June 2024)
- Those concerned about MBTA's $24.5 billion maintenance backlog

### Healey Administration Position
- No endorsement of NSRL
- Prioritizing: Cape Cod bridges, West-East Rail, Red-Blue Connector, South Station expansion
- "Open to discussion" per Moulton, but no concrete action

## Arguments For and Against

### FOR
1. **Regional connectivity**: Direct Amtrak NYC-Portland, unified commuter rail
2. **Climate benefits**: Would divert 55,000+ daily auto trips to transit
3. **Economic development**: $30B benefits, 150K housing units
4. **Capacity**: 25% increase in commuter rail seats downtown
5. **Modern tunneling**: TBM technology proven, minimal surface disruption

### AGAINST
1. **Cost**: $8-21 billion depending on estimate
2. **Construction disruption**: 2+ years of service impacts
3. **Depth concerns**: 115-195 feet deep, evacuation challenges
4. **Single point of failure**: All lines would depend on tunnel
5. **Competing priorities**: MBTA has $24.5B maintenance backlog
6. **Uncertain demand**: How many actually need north-south through trips?

## Comparison to Other Projects

| Project | Cost | Per Mile |
|---------|------|----------|
| Big Dig (Boston) | $24.3B total | ~$3.1B/mile |
| Second Avenue Subway Phase 1 (NYC) | $4.5B for 1.8 miles | $2.5B/mile |
| East Side Access (NYC) | - | $3.5B/mile |
| NSRL (estimated) | $8-21B for ~1.5 miles | $5-14B/mile |
| European average | - | $250-500M/mile |

U.S. transit tunnels cost 2-20x more than comparable international projects.

## Relevance to Kendall-Logan Assignment

The NSRL is relevant to the Kendall-Logan transit access problem because:

1. **Blue Line connection**: If Red-Blue Connector is built AND NSRL is built, Kendall would have seamless access to Airport Station via Blue Line
2. **Alternative framing**: NSRL is a long-term "moonshot" while Red-Blue Connector is more near-term feasible
3. **Same political dynamics**: Both face funding challenges, competing priorities, and require multi-agency coordination
4. **Transit advocacy ecosystem**: Same groups (TransitMatters, etc.) advocate for both

However, NSRL is likely too long-term and uncertain to be a central recommendation for the KSA memo. The Red-Blue Connector is more actionable.

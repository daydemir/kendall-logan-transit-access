# North-South Rail Link and Cambridge Commuter Rail Research

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding:** The North-South Rail Link (NSRL) does NOT include any direct connection to Cambridge. However, there is a separate, active proposal to bring commuter rail service to Cambridge/Kendall via the Grand Junction Railroad.

**Direct Cambridge Commuter Rail Option:** The Grand Junction Railroad is the ONLY viable route for direct commuter rail service to Kendall/Cambridge without transferring through North or South Station.

## 1. North-South Rail Link (NSRL) Proposed Alignments

### Overview
The NSRL is a proposed pair of rail tunnels connecting North Station and South Station in downtown Boston. The project would run approximately 1.5 miles of underground tunnels beneath the Central Artery corridor (Rose Kennedy Greenway).

### Proposed Stations
The NSRL includes three underground stations:
1. **South Station** - with 1,050-foot platforms for Amtrak intercity trains
2. **Central Station** (near Aquarium) - commuter rail-only platforms
3. **North Station** - commuter rail-only platforms

**Station Depths:** 115-195 feet underground (deeper than Porter Square, currently the MBTA's deepest station at 105 feet)

### Alignment Options
The 2018 MassDOT study examined four options:
- **Two-track options:** $12.3-14.4 billion
- **Four-track options:** $21.5 billion

All options run beneath the Central Artery/Rose Kennedy Greenway corridor.

### Cambridge Connection
**There is NO direct NSRL connection to Cambridge.** The tunnel runs entirely through downtown Boston, connecting the two existing downtown stations.

## 2. Red Line Connection to NSRL

### Current Transfer Situation
Currently, travelers between North Station and South Station must transfer through two subway lines:
- **Option 1:** Green Line → Red Line via Park Street station
- **Option 2:** Orange Line → Red Line via Downtown Crossing station

### NSRL Transfer Connections
The NSRL would create underground platforms adjacent to existing subway lines:
- South Station: connects to Red Line and Silver Line
- Central Station (Aquarium): new underground station near Blue Line
- North Station: connects to Orange Line and Green Line

**Cross-platform transfers** would allow convenient connections between commuter rail and subway lines.

### Red Line Riders Accessing NSRL
Red Line riders from Cambridge would:
1. Take Red Line to South Station, Downtown Crossing, or potentially transfer to another line for Central Station
2. Transfer to NSRL platforms via escalators/elevators
3. Board commuter rail trains running through the tunnel

This is still a transfer - not a direct connection to Cambridge.

## 3. Grand Junction Railroad - The Cambridge Commuter Rail Route

### What is the Grand Junction Railroad?

The Grand Junction is an 8.55-mile railroad line that:
- Branches off from the commuter rail system near Boston University
- Crosses the Charles River into Cambridge
- Runs through Kendall Square
- Continues to North Station

**Historical Background:** Chartered in 1847 to connect railroads entering Boston from north and west with East Boston wharves.

### Current Status (2025)

**Yes, the tracks still exist and are active** but only for limited use:
- Owned by MassDOT (MIT owns land at two segments with rail easement)
- Reduced from four tracks (1996) to one main track
- Current uses:
  - CSX freight to Schnitzer scrap yard in Everett
  - MBTA equipment transfers between north and south commuter rail systems
  - Amtrak Downeaster equipment transfers
  - Occasional freight to Chelsea Produce Market

## 4. Historical Proposals for Commuter Rail Through Cambridge

### 2010: Worcester Line to North Station via Grand Junction

**Proposal:** Lieutenant Governor Tim Murray proposed branching the Framingham/Worcester Line over the Grand Junction to provide commuter rail service from Worcester to North Station through Cambridge.

**Plans:** More than 20 trains per day at high speeds through six intersections in Cambridge and Somerville.

**Community Response:** Intense skepticism and opposition due to:
- Traffic impacts at grade crossings
- Safety concerns
- Noise impacts on residential areas

**Outcome:** In December 2011, MassDOT announced it would NOT pursue the Grand Junction for commuter rail service, opting instead to expand South Station.

### 2012: Kendall Station Feasibility Study

**Proposal:** Study of a new commuter rail station at Kendall Square
- Single platform between Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue
- Estimated cost: $7.5 million
- Part of Framingham/Worcester Line service to North Station

**Outcome:** MBTA declined to pursue after Cambridge objected over grade crossing traffic problems.

## 5. Urban Ring Proposals

### Overview
The Urban Ring was a proposed circumferential transit line, one to two miles from downtown Boston, intended to connect radial transit lines.

**Route:** Would have passed through Boston, Chelsea, Everett, Medford, Somerville, Cambridge, and Brookline.

### Three Phases
1. **Phase 1:** Expanded crosstown bus lines
2. **Phase 2:** Six overlapping bus rapid transit (BRT) lines forming a complete ring
3. **Phase 3:** Rail service from Assembly Square to Nubian Square via East Cambridge

### Cambridge/Kendall Connection

**Kendall Square was a major destination** in the Urban Ring plans:
- Estimated 13,000 daily riders would board at Kendall Square alone
- Sullivan Square → Kendall Square → Longwood Medical Area route had the largest potential ridership in the region
- Expected to convert 41,500 car trips to transit trips daily

### Current Status
**Suspended in January 2010** due to insufficient funding. Phase 2 projected cost: $2.4 billion.

**Only completed element:** Silver Line Gateway busway in Chelsea (2015)

## 6. October 2024: Cambridge Redevelopment Authority Grand Junction Study

### Study Overview
Engineering feasibility study conducted by WSP on behalf of the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA), commissioned as part of Boston Properties' mitigation for Kendall Square development.

### Proposed Service

**Route:** North Station to West Station (Allston) via Cambridge

**Frequency:** Trains every 15-17.5 minutes

**Mode:** "Urban Rail" using Electric Multiple Units (EMUs) or Battery-Electric Multiple Units (B-EMUs)
- Shorter trains: 2-4 cars
- Electric propulsion to avoid fossil fuels
- Option for battery-electric if full electrification not feasible

### Proposed Stations (4-5 stations in Cambridge)

Five potential station locations identified:
1. **Cambridgeport** (Fort Washington Park area)
2. **MIT/Massachusetts Avenue** (north side of Mass Ave intersection)
3. **Kendall Square** (north side of Broadway)
4. **East Cambridge** (south of Medford/Gore Street intersection)
5. **Cambridge Crossing** (Water Street, Somerville)

The study assessed 13 potential platform sites across these five locations.

### Ridership Projections

**Opening Year:** 5,800 - 9,800 daily boardings
**2040 Projection:** 6,500 - 11,200 daily boardings

### Travel Time Benefits

The service would **save up to 40 minutes** for commuters traveling to Kendall Square from:
- North Shore
- Worcester/Framingham
- Allston-Brighton

### Cost Estimates

**Total Project Cost:** $300-400 million
- Track renovation: $187-282 million
- Electric train car procurement: included in total
- Considered low-cost compared to other major MBTA projects

## 7. Converting Grand Junction to Passenger Service: Requirements

### Infrastructure Upgrades

#### Track Infrastructure
- **Double-tracking:** 1.3 miles from Massachusetts Avenue to Medford Street
- **Track renewal:** 136-pound continuously welded rail
- New ties and ballast
- Improved drainage
- Two-track alignment needed along nearly entire corridor
- Two "pinch points" requiring 1.5 and 3 feet of additional right-of-way

#### Grade Crossing Upgrades
- **6 roadway crossings:** Upgrade with flashers, gates, bells, and signal pre-emption
- **3 pedestrian crossings:** Safety improvements
- Grade crossings identified as "most significant obstacle" to service

**Major crossings include:**
- Massachusetts Avenue
- Main Street
- Broadway
- Cambridge Street

#### Signal and Safety Systems
- Positive Train Control (PTC) over 2-mile segment
- Modern signal system
- Coordination with street signals at grade crossings

#### Bridge Work
- Draw One Bridge over the Charles River (connecting to North Station)
  - MBTA received $472 million federal grant in September for replacement
  - Essential for Grand Junction passenger service

### Electrification Options

**Two approaches:**
1. **Full electrification:** Overhead catenary system
2. **Battery-Electric Multiple Units (B-EMUs):** No overhead wires needed
   - Example: Similar to battery-EMU trains adopted in Chicago
   - Allows operation without full corridor electrification

### Freight Compatibility
Service must maintain compatibility with existing:
- CSX freight operations
- MBTA equipment transfers
- Amtrak Downeaster equipment transfers

### Key Dependencies

The Grand Junction service depends on two major external projects:

1. **North Station Capacity Expansion**
   - Needed to accommodate Grand Junction trains
   - Draw One Bridge replacement project ($472 million federal grant awarded September 2024)

2. **I-90 Allston Multimodal Project**
   - Creates West Station
   - Repositions Massachusetts Turnpike
   - Realigns Worcester commuter rail and Grand Junction to connect with new West Station
   - Essential for western terminus of service

## 8. Community Concerns and Challenges

### Grade Crossing Safety

**The Issue:**
- Six grade crossings through Cambridge
- Current crossings only have flashing lights (due to minimal current use)
- High-frequency passenger service would require full gates and signals
- Impacts on street traffic, buses (including MBTA Route 1), cyclists, and pedestrians

**Mitigation Requirements:**
- Full crossing gates
- Signal timing coordination
- Pre-emption systems
- Extensive safety analysis for all road users

### Noise and Vibration

**Historical Issues:**
- Locomotives idle "for 30 minutes or more in the middle of the night" on Grand Junction tracks
- Idling occurs adjacent to densely populated apartment buildings in East Cambridge/Wellington-Harrington
- Near Linden Park, between Binney Street and Cambridge Street

**Recent Developments:**
- New Cambridge Crossing developments may be changing noise perception (echoing off buildings)
- 2019: Massachusetts House funded study of noise impacts and mitigation for Grand Junction in East Cambridge

**Mitigation Plans:**
- Electric/battery-electric trains (quieter than diesel)
- Noise and vibration mitigation measures
- Barriers to preclude public access
- Ongoing community engagement

### MIT Property Constraints

MIT owns land at two critical pinch points:
1. **Cogeneration energy plant** north of Massachusetts Avenue (spans over existing track)
2. **Brain & Cognitive Sciences Complex** on Main Street

Both locations would need modifications to accommodate two-track service.

## Key Takeaway for Policy Analysis

**If you want direct commuter rail to Kendall without going through downtown, the Grand Junction is the ONLY option.** It's technically feasible, relatively affordable, and has been studied extensively. The question is political will and community buy-in, not engineering impossibility.

**NSRL and Grand Junction are separate projects that could complement each other:** NSRL connects north and south commuter rail systems through downtown, while Grand Junction would provide a crosstown connection through Cambridge, similar to how the Urban Ring was envisioned.

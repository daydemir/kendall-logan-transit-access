# Kendall Square to Logan Airport: Shuttle and BRT Options Research

## Executive Summary

This research examines creative shuttle and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) solutions to connect Kendall Square to Logan Airport, focusing on implementable short-term (0-5 years) and medium-term (5-15 years) options. Key findings:

- **Travel Time Gap**: Direct drive takes only 9-15 minutes, while current public transit requires 40+ minutes with transfers
- **Proven Model**: Logan Express Back Bay doubled ridership after reducing fares to $3 (vs. free return) and adding TSA priority
- **Quick Win Opportunity**: A Kendall Logan Express stop could be operational within 6-12 months using existing infrastructure
- **Strong Demand**: MIT students, Kendall employers, and residents face limited quality options to reach Logan
- **Multiple Funding Paths**: TMA partnerships, corporate subsidies, Massport funding, and federal BRT grants all viable

- Surface running to airport
- FREE at Logan (no fare collection at airport stations)
- 15 minutes South Station to Logan

**System Ridership:**
- 27,000 weekday riders (2023) across all Silver Line routes

**Recent Extensions (2024):**
- **SL3 Extension to Sullivan Square:**
  - $95 million capital cost
  - 6.36 miles round trip
  - 80% dedicated bus lanes
  - Expected +15,000 daily riders by 2040
  - Federal grant: $22.4 million (June 2024)

**Could Silver Line Extend to Kendall?**

**Geographic Challenge:**
- SL1 runs through South Boston to airport
- Kendall is northwest of Boston (Cambridge)
- No direct route connection
- Would require entirely new routing

**Alternative: Silver Line-Style BRT to Kendall**
- Dedicated lanes on Cambridge streets
- Queue-jump signals at intersections
- Off-board fare collection
- Level boarding platforms

**Potential Route:**
- Kendall → Broadway → Route 1A → Sumner Tunnel → Logan
- 3-4 miles total
- Estimated cost: $60-120 million (medium BRT scenario)

### 4.3 Dedicated BRT Lane Infrastructure

**Key BRT Features (from transit agencies):**

**#1 Priority: Dedicated Bus Lanes**
- Survey respondents uniformly cite this as most critical
- Transit Signal Priority (TSP) essential
- Improved delineation (barrier separation, red carpet lanes)

**Essential Infrastructure:**
- Off-board fare collection
- Elevated platforms (level boarding)
- Real-time arrival information
- Enhanced stations/shelters

**Kendall-Logan BRT Challenges:**

**Route Constraints:**
1. **Broadway/Main Street (Cambridge):** Narrow streets, mixed traffic
2. **Route 1A:** High-speed arterial, limited space for dedicated lanes
3. **Sumner Tunnel:** Cannot dedicate tunnel lane to buses only (capacity issues)

**Feasible Approach:**
- Dedicated lanes where possible (Cambridge streets)
- Queue-jump lanes at signals
- General traffic lanes on Route 1A/Sumner
- Result: Hybrid BRT, not full BRT (~40-50% dedicated)

**Cost Estimate for Kendall-Logan BRT:**
- 3.5 miles × $20-30M/mile = **$70-105 million**
- Assumes medium-range BRT with ~50% dedicated lanes
- Timeline: 5-8 years (planning, design, construction)

### 4.4 Federal Funding for BRT

**Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (2022-2026):**
- $108 billion for transit programs
- $39.2 billion for capital investment grants
- $8 billion for bus and bus facilities grants

**Grant Levels:**
- Projects >$400M: Up to 60% federal funding
- Projects <$400M: Up to 80% federal funding
- No lane dedication requirement for smaller grants

**Kendall-Logan BRT Funding Strategy:**
- Total cost: ~$70-105M (qualifies for 80% federal)
- Federal share: ~$56-84M
- State/local share: ~$14-21M
- Federal grant timeline: 2-3 years application → award

**Precedent: SL3 Extension**
- $95M total cost
- $22.4M federal grant (24%)
- Could Kendall-Logan get similar support?

## 8. RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 Immediate Action (0-6 months)

**RECOMMENDED: Peak-Only Pilot Shuttle**

**Why This First:**
- Fastest to implement (3-6 months)
- Lowest risk ($300-400K)
- Tests demand before major investment
- Can use existing operator with Logan permit
- Builds ridership data for future funding

**Action Plan:**
1. **Month 1:** KSA convenes stakeholder meeting (Massport, MIT, City, major employers)
2. **Month 2:** Secure pilot funding (corporate sponsors or Massport pilot grant)
3. **Month 3:** Contract with operator, submit Massport permit amendments
4. **Month 4:** Cambridge bus stop permit, marketing materials
5. **Month 5:** Soft launch (invitation-only, test systems)
6. **Month 6:** Public launch with major marketing push

**Pilot Specifications:**
- **Route:** Kendall T Station → Sumner Tunnel → Logan terminals
- **Schedule:** 
  - AM: 6:00am-9:00am from Kendall (every 30 min)
  - PM: 4:00pm-7:00pm from Logan (every 30 min)
- **Fare:** $3 to Logan, FREE return (Back Bay model)
- **Vehicles:** 2 buses, 20-25 seats each
- **Duration:** 6-month pilot with evaluation

**Success Criteria:**
- 200+ daily riders by Month 3
- 60%+ load factor
- 4+ star customer rating
- 50%+ mode shift from car/rideshare

### 8.2 Short-Term (6-24 months)

- Expand to full-day service (6am-11pm)
- Increase frequency to every 20 minutes during peaks
- Add weekend service
- Add TSA pre-check priority access
- Invest in permanent bus shelter with amenities

**Alternative: TMA-Operated Service**
- If Massport declines to fund
- Charles River TMA takes over operations
- Corporate consortium funding model
- Could be interim until BRT

### 8.3 Medium-Term (2-5 years)

**Enhanced Service Options:**

**Option A: Multiple Routes**
- Kendall → Logan (direct)

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **There is a clear gap**: Kendall-Logan takes 9-15 min by car but 40+ min by transit with transfers

2. **Proven model exists**: Back Bay Logan Express doubled ridership with $3 fare + free return + TSA priority

3. **Quick win is viable**: Peak-only pilot could launch in 3-6 months for $300-400K

4. **Multiple funding paths**: Corporate sponsors, Massport, federal CMAQ grants, TMA model all feasible

5. **Long-term BRT possible**: $70-105M BRT system with 80% federal funding achievable in 5-8 years

6. **Strong stakeholders**: KSA, MIT, Massport, Cambridge, major employers all have aligned interests

7. **Regulatory path clear**: Massport operating permits are standard, Cambridge supportive of transit

**RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP:** Kendall Square Association should convene stakeholder meeting with Massport, MIT, City of Cambridge, and major employers to discuss 6-month peak-only pilot shuttle launching in 2025.

# South Station to Logan Direct Rail Tunnel

**Timeline**: Long-term (2040s if started now)
**Cost**: $8-15 billion (estimated)
**Status**: Concept-level proposal by Fred Salvucci (January 2024)

## Salvucci's 2024 Proposal

### The Source
Fred Salvucci published **"Big ideas for dealing with congestion at Logan"** in [CommonWealth Beacon on January 20, 2024](https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/big-ideas-for-dealing-with-congestion-at-logan/).

### What He Proposed
> "Massport should partner with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and the MBTA to expand passenger rail capacity from South Station, **including consideration of a new rail tunnel to Logan.**"

### Context
- Sumner Tunnel closure revealed near-crisis conditions in East Boston
- Logan is closer to downtown than any other US airport except San Diego
- External auto congestion severely impacts East Boston (EJ community)
- Healey's climate goal: intercity trips <250 miles belong on rail, not aviation

---

## Engineering Considerations

### Distance
- South Station to Logan terminals: 4-5 miles
- Would require fourth harbor crossing (after Sumner, Callahan, Ted Williams)

### Route Options
| Option | Description | Precedent |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Under harbor | Similar to Ted Williams Tunnel | Ted Williams: 1.6 mi, 0.75 mi underwater |
| Under East Boston | Through neighborhoods | Blue Line East Boston Tunnel (1904) |
| Combined | Partial harbor, partial land | Most likely approach |

### Technology Choice
**Likely: Electrified Regional Rail (EMUs)**
- Serves Worcester, Providence, South Shore lines directly
- Better luggage accommodation
- Allows through-running with NSRL if built
- Precedent: Narita Express (Tokyo), Leonardo Express (Rome), Heathrow Express (London)

## Cost Estimates

### Tunnel Benchmarks
| Project | Cost per Mile | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Ted Williams Tunnel (1995) | $812M-1.19B | Adjusted: $1.5-2.2B/mile in 2025 |
| Second Avenue Subway Phase 2 | $4B/mile | "Highest cost in history of world" |
| East Side Access | $3.5-8.8B/mile | "Most expensive mile on earth" |
| European average | $250-500M/mile | International best practice |

### Estimated Cost for South Station-Logan
| Scenario | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Optimistic (international best practice) | $2.5-3.6 billion |
| Realistic (US average) | $8-12 billion |
| Pessimistic (Boston premium) | $12-20 billion |

---

## Comparison to Alternatives

| Option | Cost | Time Savings | Who Benefits |
|--------|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Red-Blue Connector** | $850M | 10-15 min | Cambridge, Red Line communities |
| **Enhanced Silver Line** | <$100M | Minimal | Already operational |
| **South Station-Logan Tunnel** | $8-15B | 20-30 min | South Shore, Worcester, Providence, Amtrak |

### Key Trade-off
Red-Blue Connector is 1/10th the cost and serves different population (Red Line communities). South Station tunnel serves South Shore, Worcester, Providence lines that Red-Blue doesn't help.

## Integration with NSRL

### Could Be Built as Part of NSRL
- NSRL builds main North-South tunnel (~1.5 miles)
- Logan spur branches east from South Station area (~4-5 miles)
- Total cost: $20-35 billion combined
- Allows some through-running trains to serve Logan

### Operational Models
| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Some through-running | Providence → South Station → Logan → North Station → Lowell |
| Dedicated express | North Station ↔ South Station ↔ Logan (every 10-15 min) |
| Hybrid | Both through-running and dedicated service |

---

## Who Benefits

### Primary Beneficiaries
| Group | Current Option | Improvement |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| South Shore (Red Line) | Red → Silver Line (40 min) | Direct (15-20 min) |
| Worcester Line (50K daily) | Train → South Station → Silver Line (25-35 min) | Direct (10-15 min) |
| Providence/Attleboro (30K daily) | Same as Worcester | Direct |
| Amtrak from NYC/Providence | Taxi or Red → Silver | Direct platform connection |

### Secondary Benefits
- Reduces car trips to airport
- Supports mode shift from short-haul flights
- Enhances Worcester, Providence as business locations

---

## Political Feasibility

### Current Status: VERY LOW
- State focused on MBTA stabilization, not expansion
- No major champion at governor/legislative level
- "Big Dig 2.0" concerns

### What Would Need to Change
1. NSRL gains momentum (provides foundation)
2. Federal infrastructure funding increases
3. Climate pressure intensifies
4. Business community organizes advocacy

### Realistic Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Earliest |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Planning/design | 3-5 years | 2028-2030 |
| Construction | 8-12 years | 2030-2042 |
| **Total** | **11-17 years** | **2036-2042** |

---

## Recommendation

### Position for KSA
- **Acknowledge as long-term option** but don't prioritize
- Advocate for **NSRL first** (enables Logan spur later)
- Focus near-term on shuttle, Red-Blue Connector, Grand Junction

### The Salvucci Vision
This proposal should be understood as part of Salvucci's integrated regional rail vision:
- NSRL enables through-running
- Electrification enables speed
- Logan tunnel completes the system

**Most realistic scenario**: NSRL (if built 2035-2040) → Logan spur (2040s) → Full regional rail network (2050s)

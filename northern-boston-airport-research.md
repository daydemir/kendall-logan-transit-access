# Northern Greater Boston Airport Research
## Potential Locations for New/Expanded Regional Airport with Commuter Rail Connectivity

**Research Date**: December 7, 2025  
**Context**: Analysis of potential airport locations in Northern Greater Boston that could connect to MBTA Commuter Rail (Haverhill, Lowell, Fitchburg, Newburyport/Rockport Lines)

---

## Executive Summary

Three existing airports in Northern Greater Boston present potential for expansion or enhancement as regional alternatives to Logan Airport:

1. **Hanscom Field (Bedford)** - Largest facility, significant constraints
2. **Beverly Regional Airport** - Actively expanding, strong growth trajectory
3. **Lawrence Municipal Airport** - Smaller, good commuter rail access

A fourth option is **Manchester-Boston Regional Airport (NH)** with proposed commuter rail extension via Lowell Line.

**Key Finding**: No formal Massachusetts state study has proposed building a new major commercial airport north of Boston. Current policy focuses on regional coordination among existing airports rather than new construction.

### Runway Infrastructure
**Primary Runway 11/29:**
- Length: 7,011 feet × 150 feet
- Surface: Asphalt, grooved
- Equipment: High-intensity edge lighting, ILS with DME, PAPI (3.00°)
- Capacity: Can handle large jets

**Secondary Runway 05/23:**
- Length: 5,107 feet × 150 feet  
- Surface: Asphalt, grooved
- Equipment: Medium-intensity edge lights, REIL, PAPI

**Tower Operations**: 7:00 AM - 11:00 PM

**Assessment**: Runway 11/29 at 7,011 feet can accommodate most narrow-body commercial aircraft (Boeing 737, Airbus A320 family) but would be marginal for larger wide-body aircraft. For comparison, Logan's longest runway is 10,083 feet.

### Current Status & Proposed Expansion (2024)

**Current Use**: 
- Primarily corporate, business, and general aviation
- New England's busiest private jet airport
- 3 Fixed Base Operators (FBOs): Jet Aviation, Ross Aviation, Signature Flight Support

**Expansion Controversy (2024)**:
- **Proposal**: Add 500,000 sq ft of hangar space (17 new hangars + renovations)
- **Status**: REJECTED by MA Secretary of Energy & Environmental Affairs (June 2024)
- **Opposition**: 1,500+ public comments, 13,500 petition signatures
- **Issues**: Environmental impact, climate concerns, "greenwashing" accusations
- **Current State**: Project in limbo; developers required to submit Supplementary DEIR

**Key Opposition Points**:
- Developers claimed expansion would reduce flights (via "ferry flight theory")
- State analysis found only 132 actual ferry flights vs. 3,500 claimed
- Institute for Policy Studies report: serves "mainly wealthy travelers flying to luxury destinations"
- Climate law complications: MA 2024 climate law requires proving GHG emissions weighed against benefits

### Commuter Rail Access

**Current Access**: NONE

**Nearest Commuter Rail Stations**:
- **Fitchburg Line**: Waltham (9 miles), Concord (7 miles), Lincoln (5 miles)
- **Lowell Line**: No convenient stations

**Potential Rail Connection**:
- Could theoretically connect to Fitchburg Line via Lincoln or Concord stations
- Would require 5-7 mile shuttle/transit connection
- No proposals currently exist

**Road Access**:
- Route 2A, Route 4/225
- Accessible via I-95 (Route 128)

### Population Catchment Area

**Middlesex County** (where Hanscom is located):
- Population: 1,668,956 (largest county in Massachusetts)
- 2025 Projection: 1,693,331
- Median household income: $126,779 (affluent)
- Demographics: 66.7% White, 13.1% Asian, 4.81% Black
- Major cities: Lowell, Cambridge, Newton, Somerville, Framingham

**Primary Catchment** (within 20 miles):
- Cambridge, Somerville, Newton, Waltham, Lexington, Bedford, Concord
- High-tech corridor (Route 128, Kendall Square commuters)
- Estimated ~800,000 people within 20-minute drive

- [Statistical Atlas: Middlesex County](https://statisticalatlas.com/county/Massachusetts/Middlesex-County/Population)

### Assessment: Commercial Expansion Potential

**STRONGLY UNLIKELY for the following reasons**:

1. **Political Opposition**: Four affluent towns with organized resistance
2. **Environmental Constraints**: Wetlands, protected species, groundwater, Superfund contamination
3. **Land Constraints**: 1,125 acres insufficient for major commercial airport (Logan: 2,384 acres)
4. **Recent Rejection**: State rejected even modest private jet expansion (2024)
5. **Climate Law**: New MA climate law requires GHG justification
6. **Historical/Cultural**: Proximity to Revolutionary War sites, protected lands
7. **No Rail Access**: Would require new infrastructure
8. **Wealthy Opposition**: Communities have resources to fight expansion legally

**Possible Limited Role**:
- Continue as corporate/business aviation reliever for Logan
- Small-scale commuter flights (Cape Air style, <30 seats)
- Emergency/military use

- Each driven by individual financial bottom lines vs. regional transportation needs

**Proposed Model**:
- Cooperative operation to serve regional air transportation
- Similar to NY-NJ Port Authority Compact of 1921 (operates JFK, LaGuardia, Newark)
- Could include Worcester and Bradley (Hartford, CT) as well
- Governance: Representatives from participating states

**Logan Congestion Crisis** (2024):
- FY 2025: 44 million passengers (highest ever, +5% over FY 2024)
- Runways, taxiways, gates, roadways severely congested
- Environmental impacts: 15 tons harmful pollutants daily
- Primarily impacts environmental justice communities

**Regional Coordination Benefits**:
- Reduce Logan overcrowding
- Better serve North Shore, Merrimack Valley, Southern NH populations
- Reduce highway congestion to Logan
- Environmental benefits (shorter drives for some passengers)

### Assessment: Manchester Airport as Northern MA Alternative

**EXISTING COMMERCIAL AIRPORT** (unlike Lawrence, Beverly, Hanscom):
- Full commercial service with major carriers
- Adequate runway length for all aircraft types
- Terminal facilities in place
- Already serves northern MA residents

**Advantages**:
1. **No Construction Required**: Already a functioning commercial airport
2. **Underutilized Capacity**: Could absorb overflow from Logan
3. **Proposed Rail Link**: Capitol Corridor would provide direct MBTA connection
4. **Population Base**: Manchester/Nashua (~200K) + Merrimack Valley MA (~630K) = ~830K
5. **State Partnership**: NH/MA cooperation for Capitol Corridor
6. **Less Congestion**: Alternative to overcrowded Logan
7. **Regional Coordination**: Part of proposed New England airport system

**Challenges**:
1. **Distance from Boston**: 53 miles (vs. Beverly 14 miles, Hanscom 14 miles)
2. **Interstate Coordination**: NH/MA political complexity
3. **Rail Project Unfunded**: Capitol Corridor still in planning, no construction timeline
4. **Current NH Opposition**: "No commuter rail system in New Hampshire" resistance
5. **Travel Time**: Even with rail, ~1.5-2 hours from Boston
6. **Not "Boston" Airport**: Branding, perception issues

**Role in Regional System**:
- **Northern Gateway**: Serve NH, Merrimack Valley, North Shore (via Haverhill/Lowell Lines)
- **Logan Overflow**: Absorb flights during peak periods
- **Specific Markets**: Routes to/from northern destinations, leisure travel
- **Lower Cost**: Potentially cheaper alternative to Logan

## 5. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

### Fitchburg Line Corridor

**Current Airports**: None of significant size along Fitchburg Line corridor

**Key Stations**: Waltham, Weston, Lincoln, Concord, West Concord, South Acton, Littleton, Ayer, Shirley, Fitchburg, Wachusett

**Nearby Airport**: Hanscom Field (5-7 miles from Lincoln/Concord stations)

**Assessment**: 
- No viable airport expansion locations beyond Hanscom (already discussed)
- Fitchburg area too distant from Boston (54 miles to Wachusett)
- Could serve as connection TO Hanscom with shuttle

**Sources**:
- [MBTA Fitchburg Line](https://www.mbta.com/schedules/CR-Fitchburg/line)
- [Fitchburg Line Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitchburg_Line)

### Worcester Regional Airport

**Location**: Worcester, MA (not Northern Boston, but on Fitchburg/Worcester Line)

**Rail Access**: EXCELLENT
- Worcester Union Station: Intermodal hub
- MBTA Framingham/Worcester Line to South Station
- "Heart to Hub" Express: 1-hour non-stop service (launched May 2023)
- Amtrak service
- Intercity bus service

**Distance**: ~45 miles west of Boston (not north)

**Assessment**: 
- Strong rail connection (better than Hanscom or Beverly)
- Wrong direction for "Northern Greater Boston" analysis
- Could serve as western regional alternative to Logan
- State has invested $30M+ in Worcester-Boston rail infrastructure

- [Framingham/Worcester Line Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham/Worcester_Line)

### Lowell Regional Transit

**Lowell**: Largest city on northern commuter rail system (113,608 population)

**Rail Access**: 
- MBTA Lowell Line
- 6,485 daily riders (October 2022)
- 59% of pre-COVID ridership recovered
- Connection point for proposed Capitol Corridor to NH

**Airport**: NO airport in Lowell proper

**Industrial Development**:
- Ayer's City Industrial Park: 108 acres, 20-year redevelopment plan
- Hamilton Canal District: 13 acres vacant/underutilized land
- Brownfields program: 52 vacant/underutilized industrial properties identified
- Strong manufacturing base (16% of workforce)
- University of Massachusetts Lowell campus nearby

**Could Lowell Support a New Airport?**

**Theoretical Advantages**:
- Large population base (113K city, larger metro)
- Strong industrial economy
- Available land (brownfields, industrial sites)
- Excellent rail access (Lowell Line + proposed Capitol Corridor)
- University presence
- Central location for Merrimack Valley

**Critical Challenges**:
1. **No Existing Airport Infrastructure**: Would be building from scratch
2. **Cost**: New airport construction extremely expensive ($1-5 billion+)
3. **Environmental**: Former industrial city, brownfields, Merrimack River floodplain
4. **Competition**: Lawrence Airport only ~10 miles away
5. **Political**: No evidence of any proposals or studies
6. **Land Assembly**: 500-1,000+ acres needed, difficult in built-out city

**Assessment**: 
- **HIGHLY UNLIKELY**: No proposals, no studies, no advocacy
- Better to expand Lawrence (10 miles away) or partner with Manchester, NH
- Land better used for housing, commercial development, TOD around train stations

### Newburyport Area

**Newburyport/Rockport Line**: Serves coastal North Shore communities

**Current Airport**: Plum Island Airport (small, private/recreational)

**Catchment**: 
- Newburyport (~18,000)
- Smaller coastal communities
- Total area population: <100,000

**Assessment**: 
- **NO POTENTIAL**: Population too small for commercial airport
- Tourism-focused economy (beaches, historic seaport)
- Environmental sensitivity (Plum Island, Parker River National Wildlife Refuge)
- Better served by Beverly Regional Airport (30 miles south)

## FINDINGS: Historical Proposals & Studies

### No Major New Airport Proposals Found

**Search Result**: No evidence of formal Massachusetts state studies (2020-2025) proposing a NEW major commercial airport north of Boston.

### Current Massachusetts Policy Direction

**Regional Coordination Over New Construction**:

1. **MassDOT Aeronautics**: Massachusetts Statewide Airport System Plan (MSASP)
   - Assesses current condition of 38 public-use airports
   - Provides long-term vision and funding priorities
   - Focuses on maintaining/upgrading EXISTING airports
   - No proposals for new commercial airports

2. **Existing Airport Investments** (2024-2025):
   - 6 MA municipal airports received $3.2M+ federal funding for safety/efficiency
   - Lawrence Municipal: $475K for drainage/erosion
   - 34 airports: $8.4M for on-call pavement maintenance
   - Beverly, Hanscom, others: Terminal upgrades, runway improvements

3. **Regional Airport System Proposals** (2024):
   - Coordination among Logan, Manchester, T.F. Green, Worcester, Bradley
   - Modeled on NY-NJ Port Authority
   - Focus on using existing capacity, not building new airports

**Sources**:
- [Mass.gov: MA Statewide Airport System Plan](https://www.mass.gov/massachusetts-statewide-airport-system-plan-msasp)
- [Mass.gov: Six Airports Receiving Federal Funding](https://www.mass.gov/news/six-massachusetts-municipal-airports-receiving-more-than-32-million-in-federal-funding-to-enhance-safety-and-efficiency)
- [Boston Globe: Regional Airport System Op-Ed](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/25/opinion/regional-airport-system/)

### Why No New Airport Proposals?

**Likely Reasons**:

1. **Extreme Cost**: New commercial airports cost $5-20 billion
2. **Land Assembly**: Need 1,000-2,000+ acres (difficult/impossible in built-out Massachusetts)
3. **Environmental Review**: Years of NEPA/MEPA process, likely litigation
4. **Political Opposition**: NIMBY, especially in affluent areas
5. **Existing Capacity**: Logan, Manchester, T.F. Green can handle regional demand with coordination
6. **Cheaper Alternatives**: Expand existing airports for fraction of new construction cost

### Historical Context: Reagan and the Big Dig

**1987 Reagan Veto**:
- President Reagan vetoed Central Artery (Big Dig) funding
- Cited lack of North-South Rail Link in veto message
- Massachusetts removed NSRL from project to secure veto override votes
- Veto overridden by Congress by ONE VOTE

**Implication**: Even when politically powerful (Big Dig), major transportation infrastructure is extremely difficult to advance in Massachusetts. A new airport would face even steeper odds.

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY ANALYSIS

### Most Viable Option: Beverly Regional Airport Expansion

**Reasoning**:
1. Active growth trajectory (#9 to #2 in 3 years)
2. Good rail access (3 mi to Newburyport/Rockport Line, 11K daily riders)
3. Supportive local management ("preparing for commuter service")
4. 600K population catchment (North Shore + Route 128)
5. State investment ongoing (MassDOT Aeronautics program)
6. Less political opposition than Hanscom
7. Existing infrastructure to build upon

**Development Path**:
- Phase 1: Verify/extend runway to 6,000+ feet for regional jets
- Phase 2: Small-scale commuter service (1-2 routes, 30-50 seat aircraft)
- Phase 3: Airport-rail shuttle (Beverly Depot to BVY)
- Phase 4: Expand based on demand (Florida, Chicago, DC routes)

**Model**: Westchester County Airport (HPN) serving NYC metro

### Secondary Option: Lawrence-Manchester Regional Partnership

**Reasoning**:
1. Excellent rail access for Lawrence (2 mi to Haverhill Line)
2. Manchester already has commercial service
3. Capitol Corridor proposal links both via Lowell
4. Serves large combined market (630K Merrimack Valley + 200K Southern NH)
5. Interstate cooperation precedent (NY-NJ Port Authority model)

**Development Path**:
- Phase 1: Advance Capitol Corridor commuter rail (Lowell-Nashua-Manchester)
- Phase 2: Integrated ticketing/service (MBTA + Manchester Airport)
- Phase 3: Possible Lawrence runway extension for regional overflow
- Phase 4: Full New England Regional Airport Authority

### Long-Shot Option: Hanscom Limited Commercial

**Reasoning**:
1. Best existing infrastructure (7,011 ft runway, 1,125 acres)
2. Largest Middlesex County catchment (1.67M)
3. High-income market (median $126K)

**HOWEVER**:
- Extremely strong political opposition (4 affluent towns)
- 2024 rejection of even private jet expansion
- Environmental constraints (wetlands, Superfund site, protected species)
- Climate law hurdles

**Only Viable Path**:
- Very limited commercial service (1-2 routes max)
- Premium business routes (Boston-SF, Boston-Seattle tech shuttles)
- Electric/hydrogen aircraft (climate-friendly)
- Requires major political shift + environmental mitigation

## DATA GAPS & FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDED

1. **Beverly Airport Runway Specifications**: Exact current length and extension feasibility
2. **Environmental Assessments**: Detailed wetlands, noise, air quality studies for all three airports
3. **Demand Analysis**: Market research on North Shore/Merrimack Valley air travel demand
4. **Cost Estimates**: Engineering studies for:
   - Beverly runway extension + terminal expansion
   - Lawrence runway extension to 6,000+ feet
   - Airport-rail shuttle systems
5. **Capitol Corridor Timeline**: Updated schedule and funding status for NH commuter rail
6. **Manchester Airport Capacity**: Current utilization vs. capacity, expansion potential
7. **Comparative International Models**: European/Asian regional airport + rail integration examples
8. **Climate Impact Analysis**: GHG emissions of different scenarios vs. driving to Logan

---

## CONCLUSION

**No new airport construction is likely or advisable** given:
- Extreme costs ($5-20 billion)
- Land constraints in built-out region
- Environmental/political opposition
- Existing alternatives (Logan, Manchester, potential Beverly expansion)

**Most realistic path forward**:

1. **Near-term** (2-5 years): 
   - Expand Beverly Regional Airport for small-scale commuter service
   - Implement airport-rail shuttle (Beverly Depot to BVY)
   - Advance Logan Express to North Shore

2. **Medium-term** (5-10 years):
   - Build Capitol Corridor (Lowell-Nashua-Manchester) for rail access to Manchester Airport
   - Establish New England Regional Airport Coordination (Logan-Manchester-Green-Worcester-Bradley)

3. **Long-term** (10+ years):
   - Evaluate Beverly expansion results
   - Consider Lawrence runway extension if demand warrants
   - Potential limited Hanscom commercial if political landscape shifts

**This regional coordination approach is more financially viable, politically feasible, and environmentally sustainable than attempting to build or massively expand a single new commercial airport in Northern Greater Boston.**
